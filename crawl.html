<h2 id="a.--------------------------------overview">A.                                OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>Crawl is a fun game in the grand tradition of similar games like Rogue,<br>
Hack and Moria. The objective is to travel deep into a subterranean cave<br>
complex and retrieve the Orb of Zot, guarded by many horrible and hideous<br>
creatures.</p>
<p>If you have never played Crawl (or a similar game) before, select the<br>
tutorial from the starting menu. The tutorial explains the interface in<br>
five easy lessons. Once you’re familiar with the controls, you may want to<br>
play a few games using hints mode.</p>
<p>Detailed instructions for playing Crawl follow. To simplify this manual, we<br>
assume you’re using the standard distribution and you’ve not changed the<br>
default options. If you don’t want to read the whole manual and prefer a<br>
short summary of the important points, review the quick-start guide file<br>
(quickstart.txt) and learn as you play.</p>
<p>You can also read these documents while playing Crawl by hitting ‘?’ at the<br>
help menu. A list of frequently asked questions about gameplay and design<br>
can be accessed by pressing ‘?Q’ in the game.</p>
<p>While Crawl is strictly a single player game, you can interact with others<br>
over a server. Connecting to a server opens several interesting options.</p>
<p>You can:</p>
<ul>
<li>watch other players and even communicate with them</li>
<li>view your past games or those of others</li>
<li>battle ghosts of other players</li>
<li>compete using a common score list</li>
<li>take part in the semiannual tournament</li>
<li>play the most recent development version</li>
</ul>
<p>See the Crawl website to find an online server, links to download the game<br>
for offline play, and other community resources:</p>
<p><a href="http://crawl.develz.org/">http://crawl.develz.org/</a></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="b.-----------------------------starting-screen">B.                             STARTING SCREEN</h2>
<p>At the Crawl start screen, you will be presented with various game modes, a<br>
list of saved games (if any), and will be prompted to type a name for your<br>
character. You can navigate the game modes and saved games with the cursor<br>
‘up’ and ‘down’ arrow keys.</p>
<p>Game modes are:</p>
<p>Dungeon Crawl<br>
Start a standard game of Crawl.</p>
<p>Choose game seed<br>
Start a standard game of Crawl with a custom seed (see “Seeded play”<br>
below).</p>
<p>Tutorial for Dungeon Crawl<br>
Start one of several specialised tutorials to learn how to play.</p>
<p>Hints Mode for Dungeon Crawl<br>
Start a standard game of Crawl, modified to provide help as you play.</p>
<p>Dungeon Sprint<br>
Start one of several single-map challenge mode games of Crawl.</p>
<p>Instructions<br>
View the instructional help text you are currently reading.</p>
<p>The Arena<br>
Initiate an automated fight mode between two specified combatant groups.</p>
<p>High Scores<br>
View scores for prior games played, sorted by decreasing score.</p>
<p>Pressing ‘enter’ immediately after typing your name will select standard<br>
Dungeon Crawl mode, and you will be prompted to select a species and<br>
background. Names are unique; entering a name from the saved game list will<br>
continue that saved game. If you select a game mode instead of entering a<br>
name, you will eventually be prompted to enter a name.</p>
<p>You can choose species and background in either order or randomise any<br>
combination if you would rather have the game decide for you. If both are<br>
random, you will be prompted to confirm the chosen combination before the<br>
game starts.</p>
<p>The choice of species affects several important characteristics, in<br>
particular the speed at which you learn different skills. This is very<br>
important, and helps to clearly differentiate the many available species.<br>
The following factors are species-dependent:</p>
<p>Major:</p>
<ul>
<li>The amount of hit points you get each level</li>
<li>Your rate of skill advancement</li>
<li>Your initial primary attributes (this also depends on background)</li>
<li>Various special abilities, powers and limitations</li>
</ul>
<p>Minor:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your rate of level advancement</li>
<li>Occasional bonus points added to some primary attributes</li>
<li>The amount of magic points you get each level</li>
<li>Your innate willpower, your resistance to subtle magic</li>
<li>Your initial equipment (this also depends on background)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note:  Humans are the average to which all other species are compared.</p>
<p>The choice of character background is definitely less decisive than that of<br>
species in Crawl. Basically, the background determines what the character<br>
has learned prior to entering the dungeon (i.e. the starting skills), and<br>
also helps determine equipment at start.</p>
<p>You will notice that a different set of backgrounds will be recommended<br>
(white) for each species. Although you are free to pick any background with<br>
almost any species (the only restrictions are religious backgrounds where<br>
some species are not permitted to worship certain gods, or backgrounds<br>
where the starting equipment is completely unusable by a given species),<br>
looking at the recommended combinations should give you a rough impression<br>
of the weaknesses, strengths, and roleplaying flavour of the different<br>
species.</p>
<p>For some backgrounds, you must pick a starting weapon before starting the<br>
game.</p>
<p>When you start a new character (or load an old one) and want to get a rough<br>
impression, you may read the full character dump with ?# or examine it with<br>
the following commands:</p>
<p>A<br>
shows any peculiarities like unusual speed or body parts</p>
<p>m<br>
shows your skills and lets you disable (or focus) training as desired</p>
<p>i<br>
lists equipment and items</p>
<p>^<br>
displays information on your god, should you have started with a religion</p>
<p>%<br>
gives a general, if terse, overview of your gear and most attributes</p>
<p>Ctrl-O<br>
gives an overview of the parts of the dungeon you have discovered so far</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="c.--------------------------attributes-and-stats">C.                          ATTRIBUTES AND STATS</h2>
<p>The stat area to the right of the playing map shows a lot of information.<br>
It starts with the character’s name and title (determined by the<br>
character’s highest skill), followed by a line listing the species. If the<br>
character worships a god, the name of the deity is also listed in the<br>
second line, together with an indicator of piety. Below these two lines<br>
follow a lot of numbers. These describe different aspects of the character.</p>
<p>Health<br>
A measure of life force. Synonymous with hit points and sometimes<br>
abbreviated as HP. You die if your health drops to zero or less (although<br>
you can die in other ways, too). The main screen shows both your current<br>
and maximum hit points. Usually, you regain hit points slowly over time.<br>
Pressing ‘5’ or Shift-Num-5 lets you wait for a longer period.</p>
<p>Magic<br>
A measure of magic or other intrinsic power. This is used primarily for<br>
spellcasting, but is sometimes also used for the evoking and invoking of<br>
many other special abilities. They are displayed in the same way as hit<br>
points; nothing bad happens if these drop to zero, except, of course,<br>
that you can’t cast any spells. Resting also restores your reserves of<br>
magic.</p>
<p>Next come your defences. For all of them, more is better.</p>
<p>Armour Class<br>
Abbreviated to “AC”. Your AC reduces the amount of damage you suffer from<br>
most attacks (with a few rare exceptions), and provides some guaranteed<br>
minimum protection against damage from melee attacks.</p>
<p>Evasion<br>
Abbreviated to “EV”. This helps you avoid being hit by unpleasant things<br>
(but will not reduce the amount of damage you suffer if you do get hit).</p>
<p>Shield<br>
Abbreviated to “SH”. This number is a measure of how good your shield (if<br>
any) is at blocking attacks.</p>
<p>Your character’s primary attributes are Strength, Intelligence and<br>
Dexterity:</p>
<p>Strength<br>
Abbreviated to “Str”. Increases your damage with melee weapons (except<br>
for long and short blades). Reduces penalties from wearing heavy armour.</p>
<p>Intelligence<br>
Abbreviated to “Int”. Affects your odds of successfully casting spells<br>
and how powerful those spells are.</p>
<p>Dexterity<br>
Abbreviated to “Dex”. Increases your accuracy with melee and ranged<br>
weapons, and your damage with ranged weapons and long and short blades.<br>
Significantly affects your ability to dodge attacks aimed at you, your<br>
effectiveness with shields, your stealth, and your effectiveness when<br>
stabbing unaware enemies.</p>
<p>These primary attributes grow permanently from gaining levels, and may<br>
increase or decrease temporarily from mutations or while using certain<br>
artefacts or abilities. Upon gaining levels 3, 9, 15, etc., you may choose<br>
an attribute to raise by two points. Most species gain additional<br>
attributes at some levels, with the frequency and the attribute to be<br>
increased determined by species.</p>
<p>If any attribute drops to zero for some reason, you will experience very<br>
unpleasant side-effects, being slowed and suffering some stat-specific<br>
negative effects. These effects will persist for a short while even after<br>
the attribute is restored.</p>
<p>Finally some additional information about your character and your progress<br>
through the dungeon is displayed.</p>
<p>Experience Level<br>
Abbreviated to “XL”. Starting characters have experience level 1; the<br>
highest possible level is 27. Gaining a level nets additional hit and<br>
magic points, and will grant spell slots and sometimes primary<br>
attributes.</p>
<p>Place<br>
This shows the branch you are currently in, as well as the level within<br>
the branch. The starting branch is called Dungeon, so that the place<br>
information will read “Dungeon:1” for a new character.</p>
<p>Noise<br>
This is a coloured bar indicating the loudness of noise that you heard on<br>
your last turn. The colour provides a rough guide to how far away the<br>
noise it indicates might be audible. If the bar is gray, the sound is<br>
less likely to be audible outside of your line of sight (at least in an<br>
open area); if it is yellow, the sound is likely to be audible outside of<br>
your line of sight; and if it is red, the sound will be audible at a<br>
substantial distance. If the bar turns magenta, you have made one of the<br>
loudest noises in the dungeon. N.b.: terrain can reduce or block the<br>
spread of noise.</p>
<p>Time<br>
This indicates the amount of time that has passed since entering the<br>
dungeon, and also displays in brackets the amount of time that your<br>
previous action took. Most actions take 1.0 units of time, but certain<br>
actions are particularly slow or quick (such as changing armour and<br>
swapping weapons respectively), and other actions can vary in time taken<br>
depending on your status (such as attacking with different weapons and at<br>
different skill levels).</p>
<p>There are some additional stats that aren’t as important on a turn to turn<br>
basis and thus aren’t listed in the main stats area. They can easily be<br>
checked with the ‘@’ or ‘%’ commands, though.</p>
<p>Willpower<br>
Affects your ability to resist the effects of enchantments and similar<br>
magic directed at you. Has no effect on direct damage dealt by magic,<br>
just on more subtle effects. Although your willpower increases with your<br>
level to an extent determined by your character’s species, the creatures<br>
you will meet deeper in the dungeon are better at casting spells, and are<br>
more likely to be able to affect you. You can get a rough idea of your<br>
current Will by pressing ‘%’.</p>
<p>Size<br>
Different species have different sizes: Spriggans and Felids are very<br>
small; Kobolds are small; Ogres and Trolls are large; Nagas and<br>
Palentongas are large with a medium torso; all other species are<br>
medium-sized. Many transmutations will change your size. Size affects<br>
your evasion: the smaller your character, the more evasive it is. On the<br>
other hand, characters of larger than medium size do not suffer the usual<br>
attack penalties when standing in shallow water. Characters of smaller<br>
than medium size will have problems with some larger weapons. Very small<br>
characters and large characters are not able to use most types of armour.<br>
Players and monsters can only constrict foes of the same size or smaller.<br>
In the dungeon you can also meet tiny and giant foes.</p>
<p>Stealth<br>
High stealth allows your character to move through the dungeon<br>
undetected. It is affected by your species, dexterity, Stealth skill, and<br>
the encumbrance of your body armour. Your current Stealth level can also<br>
been seen by pressing ‘@’ or ‘%’.</p>
<p>There are many ailments or enchantments that can temporarily befall you.<br>
These are noted in the stats area below the experience line. Many of them<br>
are self-explanatory, like Pois or Slow. Many others, however, can be<br>
subtle, and their effects can be examined by pressing ‘?/T’ and searching<br>
for the name of status effect.</p>
<p>Monsters within your field of vision are listed on a special panel, the<br>
monster list. Single monsters also get indicators of their health status in<br>
the form of a coloured box, and also on effects they enjoy or suffer from.<br>
If there are many monsters in view, the extended monster list can be<br>
displayed with ‘Ctrl-X’. Within target mode you can directly target single<br>
monsters by use of the monster list by using ‘Ctrl-X’.</p>
<p>Sometimes characters will be able to use special abilities, e.g. the Naga’s<br>
ability to spit poison or the magical power to turn invisible granted by a<br>
scarf of invisibility. These are accessed through the ‘a’ command.</p>

<h2 id="d.--------------------------exploring-the-dungeon">D.                          EXPLORING THE DUNGEON</h2>
<h1 id="movement">Movement</h1>
<p>You can make your character walk around with the numeric keypad (try both<br>
Numlock on and off) or the “Rogue” keys (hjklyubn). If this is too slow,<br>
you can make your character walk repeatedly by pressing Shift and a<br>
direction; alternatively, press ‘/’ followed by a direction. You will walk<br>
in that direction until any of a number of things happen: a hostile monster<br>
is visible on the screen, a message is sent to the message window for any<br>
reason, you press a key, or you are about to step on anything other than<br>
normal floor and it is not your first move of the long walk. Note that this<br>
is functionally equivalent to just pressing the direction key several<br>
times.</p>
<p>Another convenient method for moving long distances is described in the<br>
section on Automated Travel and Exploration below.</p>
<h1 id="combat">Combat</h1>
<p>The dungeon is a hostile place, and you will likely need to defend<br>
yourself. The basic case of combat involves melee attacks: if you are<br>
adjacent to a monster, moving towards that monster will cause you to attack<br>
it with a wielded melee weapon, or your fists. There are also a wide<br>
variety of ways to attack monsters that are further away, including<br>
polearms (which can reach a tile away), various bows, launchers, and<br>
throwable items, magical items that can be evoked such as wands, spells,<br>
and abilities. These are described throughout the rest of this document.<br>
These are triggered in a variety of ways, but one commonality is that all<br>
of these can be quivered: the quiver provides quick access to an action<br>
that can be fired.</p>
<p>Both melee and ranged combat provide shortcuts that autotarget the nearest<br>
enemy, if there is one available. Your wielded weapon can be triggered by<br>
Tab (“Autofight”), moving towards or attacking the nearest enemy depending<br>
on whether there is one in range for the weapon. Your quivered action can<br>
be triggered by Shift-Tab or ‘p’ (“Autofire”); if the action takes a target<br>
the nearest enemy will be selected, otherwise the action will be triggered.<br>
See “Attacking and firing” for the full key list related to attacking,<br>
quivers, and firing.</p>
<h1 id="resting">Resting</h1>
<p>If you press ‘5’, you will rest until your hit points or magic return to<br>
full. You can rest for just one turn by pressing ‘.’ or ‘s’.</p>
<p>Resting stops if a monster appears or if you are otherwise interrupted.</p>
<h1 id="examining-your-surroundings">Examining your surroundings</h1>
<p>The section of the viewing window which is coloured (with the “@”<br>
representing you at the centre) is what you can see around you. The dark<br>
grey around it is the parts of the level which you have visited, but cannot<br>
currently see. The ‘x’ command lets you move the cursor around to get a<br>
description of the various dungeon features, and typing ‘v’ when the cursor<br>
is over a monster or feature brings up a short description of that monster,<br>
as well as a short list of its various strengths, weaknesses, immunities,<br>
and any spells or abilities it has. This is generally useful with monsters<br>
you’ve never encountered before. You can also select monsters and features<br>
from a list by pressing ‘Ctrl-X’. You can get a map of the whole level<br>
(which shows where you’ve already been) by typing ‘X’.</p>
<p>You can see the full set of commands available while looking around by<br>
pressing ‘?’, both in the ‘x’ and ‘X’ modes.</p>
<h1 id="staircases-and-portals">Staircases and Portals</h1>
<p>You can make your way between levels by using staircases, which appear as<br>
“&gt;” (down) and “&lt;” (up), by pressing the ‘&gt;’ or ‘&lt;’ keys. It is important<br>
to know that most monsters adjacent to you will follow when you change<br>
levels; this holds both for hostile and allied monsters. Notable exceptions<br>
are zombies and other mindless undead, who are too stupid to properly<br>
operate stairs.</p>
<p>When taking stairs with an unknown destination, you are guaranteed a chance<br>
to move before any adjacent monsters. When taking stairs that you’ve<br>
already seen the other side of, monsters will be alert and get a chance to<br>
move before you.</p>
<p>If you ascend an up staircase on level one, you will leave the dungeon<br>
forever; if you are carrying the magical Orb of Zot, you win the game by<br>
doing this. Otherwise, the game ends, and you lose.</p>
<p>Besides the dungeon you start in, Crawl’s dungeon has many branches. All of<br>
them are themed and host opponents of some special sort. It is not<br>
mandatory to visit any particular branch, but you must explore some of<br>
them: progress to the Realms of Zot (where the Orb is located) is only<br>
possible for adventurers who have at least three magical runes of Zot. The<br>
bottoms of several branches contain such runes.</p>
<p>Occasionally you will find an archway (displayed as “” or as an actual<br>
arch); these lead to special places like shops, themed one-off portals, or<br>
special branches such as Hell and Pandemonium. You can enter these by<br>
typing ‘&lt;’ or ‘&gt;’. A few portals only accept one of ‘&lt;’ and ‘&gt;’.</p>
<h1 id="doors-and-traps">Doors and Traps</h1>
<p>Doors can usually be opened by just walking into them (there is an option<br>
to disable this); else this can also be done using the ‘O’ command. They<br>
can be closed with the ‘C’ command. Pressing Ctrl plus a direction, or ‘*’<br>
followed by a direction, will open/close doors, too.</p>
<p>If there is no door in the indicated space, both Ctrl-direction and<br>
‘*’-direction will attempt to attack any monster which may be standing<br>
there (this is the only way to attack a friendly creature with melee<br>
combat). If there is apparently nothing there, you will still attack it,<br>
just in case there’s something invisible lurking around.</p>
<p>The malevolent forces of Zot will attempt to thwart your progress through<br>
the dungeon, and will occasionally manifest traps to force you into<br>
dangerous situations. Some traps are visible in advance and can be<br>
triggered by monsters to unleash their effects on you.</p>
<h1 id="shops">Shops</h1>
<p>When you visit a shop (by using &lt; or &gt; while standing on one), you are<br>
shown what the shopkeeper has in stock and can choose what to buy.<br>
Unfortunately, the shopkeepers all have an exclusive deal with the Guild of<br>
Dungeon Procurers which prevents them using non-guild labour to obtain<br>
stock, so you can’t sell anything in a shop. (But then, what shopkeeper<br>
would buy stolen goods from a disreputable adventurer, anyway?)</p>
<p>To purchase one or more items, select them by pressing the letters of the<br>
item in the shop menu and then press Enter to make the purchase; you can<br>
examine items before buying them by pressing ‘!’ and then the letter of the<br>
item.</p>
<p>If you’ve lost track of the shops in the dungeon, you can get a list of all<br>
the shops you’ve found in the dungeon overview (use ‘Ctrl-O’).</p>
<p>You can also use the stash search: Hitting ‘Ctrl-F’ and searching for<br>
“shop” will list all stores. The stash-search menu allows you travel<br>
quickly to a particular shop; if you just want to know what’s in the shop,<br>
you can also examine the shop’s inventory from the search menu without<br>
having to travel all the way to the shop.</p>
<p>Some shops are antique stores that sell items of unknown provenance,<br>
usually at a good discount. The dungeon overview screen displays these with<br>
yellow glyphs.</p>
<p>If you’re short on gold for some particularly interesting commodity, you<br>
can place it onto your shopping list. The game will interrupt you when you<br>
have collected enough gold to finally purchase an item on that list. You<br>
can read the shopping list in the game with ‘$’.</p>
<h1 id="automated-travel-and-exploration">Automated Travel and Exploration</h1>
<p>Crawl has an extensive automated travel system: pressing ‘G’ (or also<br>
‘Ctrl-G’) lets you choose any dungeon level; the game will then take the<br>
shortest path to reach this destination. You can also use autotravel on the<br>
level map (‘X’): Move the cursor to the place where you want to go and hit<br>
Enter. There are several shortcuts when choosing destinations: For example,<br>
try ‘&lt;’ and ‘&gt;’ to quickly reach the staircases.</p>
<p>When your autotravel gets interrupted, Crawl will remember the previous<br>
destination. Hitting ‘G’ or ‘Ctrl-G’ again and following with Enter puts<br>
the cursor on that square. See Appendix 4. “List of Keys and Commands” for<br>
all commands and shortcuts in level-map mode, or press ‘G?’ or ‘X?’ within<br>
the game.</p>
<p>Another use of autotravel is exploration: ‘o’ makes your character move to<br>
the nearest unexplored area. Note that this algorithm does not attempt any<br>
optimisation by default. By manual exploration you can save turns, but<br>
auto-explore will usually save real time.</p>
<h1 id="stashes-and-searching">Stashes and Searching</h1>
<p>Since you can only carry 52 items, you will occasionally want to stash<br>
things away (by dropping them with the ‘d’ command). When you want to<br>
search for something in your stashes, you can do this with the Find command<br>
‘Ctrl-F’. The parser even accepts regular expressions, although you will<br>
mostly just need strings like ‘mutation’, ‘heal wounds’, etc. You will be<br>
presented with a list of all places where objects matching the search are<br>
(or have been) located; you can then travel there or examine the pile. The<br>
Find command will also search in shop inventories. Furthermore, you can<br>
search skills like ‘long blades’ (this will find all weapons training the<br>
long blades skill) or general terms like ‘shop’, ‘altar’, ‘portal’,<br>
‘artefact’, etc. You can get help on finding by pressing ‘?’ at the prompt.</p>
<h1 id="the-goal">The Goal</h1>
<p>Your goal is to locate the Orb of Zot, which is held somewhere deep beneath<br>
the world’s surface. The Orb is an ancient and incredibly powerful<br>
artefact, and the legends promise great things for anyone brave enough to<br>
extract it from the fearsome Dungeon. Some say it will grant immortality or<br>
even godhood to the one who carries it into the sunlight; many undead<br>
creatures seek it in the hope that it will restore them to life. But then,<br>
some people will believe anything. Good luck!</p>
<h1 id="zot">Zot</h1>
<p>No one knows who or what Zot is: demon, god, wizard, something else<br>
entirely? But adventurers seeking the Orb will, in turn, be hunted by Zot.<br>
If it finds them, it will first drain their life and then, once they are<br>
sufficiently reduced, it will end their existence.</p>
<p>Zot is very slow moving, and can only sense adventurers once they’ve spent<br>
an inordinately long time in one area of the dungeon. Even once this<br>
happens, adventurers will have plenty of warning to either descend to new<br>
depths in the area (diffusing Zot’s attention once more) or to leave the<br>
area entirely.</p>
<p>The Abyss is beyond Zot’s comprehension, and adventurers there are safe<br>
from it (albeit subject to many other hazards). The Hells, along with their<br>
Vestibule, are a single area as far as Zot is concerned. Rumours claim<br>
there are ways to escape Zot’s pursuit forever, but what magics could be<br>
mighty enough to forestall such an implacable entity?</p>
<h1 id="seeded-play">Seeded play</h1>
<p>Crawl dungeons are determined by a “seed” number used to initialise the<br>
game’s random number generator. You may either let the game choose a seed<br>
randomly, or specify a seed; if you choose a seed this puts the game in<br>
“Seeded” mode, which is scored separately. Playing games with the same seed<br>
value, as long as the game version is constant, should (within certain<br>
parameters) lead to the same dungeon. The entire connected dungeon will be<br>
determined by the game seed, including dungeon layout, monster placement,<br>
and items. Portal vaults and chaotic zones such as the abyss are not<br>
guaranteed to be the same, and the placement of rare unique artefacts may<br>
vary depending on certain player actions.</p>
<p>To set a game seed, use the “Choose game seed” option from the main menu;<br>
you can also use the ‘game_seed’ rc file option, or the ‘-seed’ command<br>
line option. In offline games you can view your game’s seed with ‘?V’ as<br>
well as in a character file; in online games a randomly chosen seed will<br>
only be shown to you after finishing the game.</p>
<p>If you find that the same seed generates distinct parts of a dungeon on the<br>
same or different devices, please report it as a bug. However, keep in mind<br>
that upgrading your save game between multiple versions of crawl will<br>
naturally lead to seed divergence. When playing offline, if you would like<br>
to ensure that your game can be upgraded without divergence, you can set<br>
‘pregen_dungeon = full’ in your options file. (This will also ensure<br>
completely stable unique artefact placement.) On the other hand, to<br>
completely disable incremental pregeneration, you can set ‘pregen_dungeon =<br>
false’.</p>
<h1 id="further-help">Further Help</h1>
<p>To access Crawl’s help menu, press ‘?’. To get the list of all commands,<br>
press ‘?’ again. A different, more verbose description of the commands also<br>
appears in Appendix 4. “List of Keys and Commands” of this text. Various<br>
other help texts are available as well, including this manual. You can also<br>
read the logbook from there by pressing ‘:’. Note that several commands<br>
have their own help screens, among them are targeting (‘f’), level map<br>
(‘X’), travel (‘G’ or ‘Ctrl-G’) and searching (‘Ctrl-F’); again, press ‘?’<br>
when asked for input.</p>
<p>If you don’t like the standard keyset (either because some keys do not work<br>
properly, or because you want to decrease the amount of typing necessary),<br>
you can use keymaps and macros. See macros_guide.txt in the docs/<br>
directory, or read it from the in-game help menu.</p>

<h2 id="e.--------------------------experience-and-skills">E.                          EXPERIENCE AND SKILLS</h2>
<p>When you kill monsters, you gain experience points (XP). When you get<br>
enough XP, you gain an experience level, making your character more<br>
powerful. As they gain levels, characters gain more hit points, magic<br>
points, and spell levels.</p>
<p>Additionally, the experience you gain is used to train your skills. These<br>
skills represent proficiency with all areas of endeavour an ambitious<br>
adventurer might need in the dungeons. They range from different weapon<br>
skills (both for close and ranged combat) to many magical skills and<br>
several additional activities like Dodging or Stealth. See Appendix 3.<br>
“List of Skills” for a detailed description of all skills present in Crawl.<br>
The ease with which a character learns a skill depends solely on species.<br>
These aptitudes are displayed when viewing your skills, and a full table<br>
can be viewed in aptitudes.txt (also from the help screen during play via<br>
‘?%’).</p>
<p>You can see your character’s skills by pressing the ‘m’ key; the higher the<br>
level of a skill, the better you are at it. All characters start with a few<br>
skills already trained (determined by their background), those which are<br>
not present have to be learned from scratch. Each skill can go up to 27.</p>
<p>The skill screen allows you to change which skills are exercised and at<br>
what speed. Note to new players: it is generally not necessary to finetune<br>
the skill selection.</p>
<p>If you want to modify skill selection, here is how:</p>
<p>There are two ways to assigning skills to practise: one is an automatic<br>
mode, which puts experience points into the skills you have used recently.<br>
The other one is a manual mode, where you specifically select the skills to<br>
train. You can switch between the modes by pressing ‘/’ in the character<br>
skill screen (‘m’); also be sure to read that screen’s help text should you<br>
want to tweak your skillset.</p>
<p>You can elect to either not practise a particular skill or to focus on it<br>
by selecting it once or twice in the skill screen.</p>
<p>Dark grey skills will not be trained, so that the skill will remain static<br>
and no experience points will be used to increase it. As a consequence,<br>
more experience will be spent on your other skills (and thus they will<br>
increase more quickly). Note that you cannot deselect all skills; at least<br>
one skill must be actively exercised.</p>
<p>Highlighted skills are focused on and will use a higher proportion of<br>
available experience. You can highlight as many skills as you like, though<br>
obviously if all skills being trained are highlighted there will be no net<br>
effect.</p>
<p>Occasionally you may find a manual of a skill which allows you to make<br>
quick progress in this area. When you pick it up, experience used to<br>
practise the given skill will have twice the usual effect for a while.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="f.--------------------------------monsters">F.                                MONSTERS</h2>
<p>In the caverns of Crawl, you will find a great variety of creatures, most<br>
of which are displayed by capital or small letters of the alphabet. Many of<br>
them would very much like to eat you. To stop them from doing this, you<br>
will generally need to fight them. To attack a monster, stand next to it<br>
and move in its direction; this makes you attack it with your wielded<br>
weapon. Of course, some monsters are just too nasty to beat, and you will<br>
find that discretion is often the better part of valour. Sneaky characters<br>
are known to choose encounters to their liking.</p>
<p>There are several other ways to kill monsters. When using a bow or other<br>
ranged weapon, the ‘v’ command will fire. See the section on Targeting in<br>
the Items Chapter for more on this. Likewise, many magicians will prefer to<br>
use spells from a safe distance. They can use the ‘z’ command to cast<br>
spells previously 'M’emorised. Again, see the Targeting section.</p>
<p>Some monsters can be friendly; friendly monsters will follow you around and<br>
fight on your behalf. You can command your allies using the ‘t’ key, which<br>
lets you tell them who to attack, or else tell them to stay where they are,<br>
retreat, or to follow you again. You can also shout to get the attention of<br>
all monsters in range if, for some reason, you want to do that.</p>
<p>Some special monsters are Uniques. You can identify a unique because he,<br>
she or they have a name and personality. Many of these come up with very<br>
nasty ideas how to rid the dungeon of you. Treat them very carefully,<br>
particularly if you meet one of them for the first time.</p>
<p>Other, even rarer, obstacles are statues. A variety of statues can appear,<br>
ranging from harmless granite ones (who still often signify something of<br>
interest) to really dreadful ones. Be alert whenever seeing such a statue.</p>
<p>When playing Crawl, you will undoubtedly want to develop a feeling for the<br>
different monster types. For example, some monsters move unpredictably<br>
while most attack head-on. Likewise, ranged or magic attackers will prove a<br>
different kind of threat from melee fighters. Learn from past deaths and<br>
remember which monsters pose the most problems. If particular monsters are<br>
giving you trouble, try to alter your tactics for future encounters.</p>
<p>You can obtain information about a monster by using the ‘x’ (examine)<br>
command, moving the cursor over the monster in question, and pressing ‘v’<br>
to view the monster’s details; or by searching for a monster by name or<br>
symbol with ‘?/m’. The details screen shows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The monster’s name and description.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bars or numbers indicating its:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Max HP: hit points; how much damage it can take</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AC: armour class; how well it ignores most damage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EV: evasion; how well it avoids being hit (and your odds of hitting it<br>
with your current melee attack)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will: willpower; its resistance to most Hexes and similar effects.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its difficulty level, speed (if different from average speed), size,<br>
resistances, and special attacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its spells and special abilities. Monster spells and abilities are<br>
of four types:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Natural abilities are innate, non-magical effects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Magical abilities are innate magical effects. They are affected<br>
by antimagic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Divine abilities call upon the monster’s god for a magical effect.<br>
They are prevented by silence, but not affected by antimagic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spells are cast using memorised magical words. They are both<br>
prevented by silence and affected by antimagic.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="g.----------------------------------items">G.                                  ITEMS</h2>
<p>In the dungeons of Crawl there are many different kinds of normal and<br>
magical items to be found and used. Some of them are useful, some are<br>
nasty, and some give great power, but at a price. Some items are unique;<br>
these have interesting properties which can make your life rather bizarre<br>
for a while. They all fall into several classes of items, each of which is<br>
used in a different way. Here is a general list of what you might find in<br>
the course of your adventures, how they are displayed, and what commands<br>
there are to use them:</p>
<p>=======  =============  ================================================<br>
)        weapons        (use 'w’ield)<br>
(        missiles       (use 'f’ire or 'F’ire, ‘Q’ to quiver)<br>
[        armour         (use 'W’ear and 'T’ake off)<br>
?        scrolls        (use 'r’ead)<br>
!        potions        (use 'q’uaff)<br>
/        wands          (use ‘V’ to evoke, ‘Q’ to quiver)<br>
=        rings          (use 'P’ut on and 'R’emove)<br>
"        amulets        (use 'P’ut on and 'R’emove)<br>
|       staves         (use 'w’ield)<br>
:        spellbooks     (use 'M’emorise and 'z’ap, ‘Q’ to quiver)<br>
}        miscellaneous  (use ‘V’ to evoke, ‘Q’ to quiver)<br>
$        gold           (use ‘g’ to pick up)<br>
=======  =============  ================================================</p>
<p>There are several general keys for item management:</p>
<p>d<br>
drop item; if you want to drop only some items from a stack (of arrows,<br>
for example), then press ‘d’ followed by a number and then the item’s<br>
slot key</p>
<p>g<br>
pick up item from the ground (also with the comma key ‘,’)</p>
<p>=<br>
reassign item slot (works also for spell slots and abilities)</p>
<p>i<br>
show inventory - pressing the key of an item shows additional information</p>
<p>{<br>
inscribe item (see Appendix 5. “Inscriptions”)</p>
<p><br>
check list of already discovered items</p>
<h1 id="item-usage">Item usage</h1>
<p>You pick up items with the 'g’et or ‘,’ (comma) command, and drop them with<br>
the 'd’rop command. When you are given a prompt like “drop which item?”, if<br>
you type a number before the letter of the item, you will drop that<br>
quantity of the item (similarly when picking up). The same works if you<br>
want to pick up only part of a stack and there are several types of items<br>
on the square (so that they are shown in a list). When there is only a<br>
single stack of arrows and you want to pick up only some of them, use the<br>
‘;’ command. Note that picking up items from one square takes exactly one<br>
turn. However, dropping several items at once takes more turns.</p>
<p>Typing ‘i’ displays your inventory (what you are carrying). When you are<br>
given a prompt like “Throw [or Wield, Wear, etc] which item?”, you usually<br>
get a list of all available options. You can press ‘*’ in case you want to<br>
wield something unusual. When the inventory screen shows “-more-”, to show<br>
you that there is another page of items, you can type the letter of the<br>
item you want, even if it is not visible, instead of pressing Space or<br>
Enter to see the next page.</p>
<p>You can carry at most 52 items at once, and your item slot usage is printed<br>
at the top of the inventory screen.</p>
<p>You can use the adjust command (the ‘=’ key) to change the letters to which<br>
your possessions are assigned. This command can be used to change spell or<br>
ability letters, too.</p>
<p>Items like scrolls, potions, and some other types each have a<br>
characteristic, like a label or a colour, which will let you tell them<br>
apart on the basis of their function. However, these characteristics change<br>
between each game, so while in one game every potion of curing may be<br>
yellow, in another game they might all be purple and bubbly. Once you have<br>
discovered the function of such an item, you will remember it for the rest<br>
of the current game. You can access your item discoveries with the ‘’ key.</p>
<p>In order to get a description of what an item does, bring up the inventory<br>
(with ‘i’) and press the letter of that item. Try this when comparing<br>
different types of armours and weapons, but don’t expect too much<br>
information from examining unidentified items.</p>
<p>In most equipment-related prompts and menus, the ‘;’ key is a shortcut for<br>
“last unequipped item,” meaning the armour, jewellery or weapon you most<br>
recently took off or unwielded.</p>
<p>Another useful command is the ‘{’ key, which lets you inscribe items with a<br>
comment. You can also inscribe items when looking at your inventory with<br>
‘i’, simply by pressing the letter of an item. For more details, and how to<br>
automate this process, check Appendix 5. “Inscriptions”.</p>
<h1 id="weapons">) Weapons</h1>
<p>These are rather important. You will find a variety of weapons in the<br>
dungeon, ranging from small and quick daggers to huge, cumbersome<br>
battleaxes and polearms. Each type of weapon does a different amount of<br>
damage, has a different chance of hitting its target, and takes a different<br>
amount of time to swing. There are several weapon skills (press ‘m’ to show<br>
a list of those that you are training) like Short Blades, Long Blades,<br>
Axes, etc. These skills affect damage, accuracy, and speed (up to a point).<br>
The same goes for Unarmed Combat.</p>
<p>Weapons can be enchanted; when you first identify them, you reveal values<br>
which tell you how much more effective they are than an unenchanted<br>
version. Weapons which are not enchanted are simply ‘+0’. Some weapons also<br>
have special magical effects which make them very effective against<br>
vulnerable enemies.</p>
<p>You can wield weapons with the ‘w’ command, which is a very quick action.<br>
If for some reason you want to go bare-handed, type ‘w’ followed by a<br>
hyphen (’-’).</p>
<p>The ’ (apostrophe) key is a shortcut which automatically wields the item in<br>
slot a. If item a is being wielded, ’ causes you to wield item b instead,<br>
if possible. Try assigning the letter a to your primary weapon, and b to<br>
your bow or something else you need to wield only sometimes. Note that this<br>
is just a typing shortcut and is not functionally different to wielding<br>
these items normally.</p>
<h1 id="missiles">( Missiles</h1>
<p>If monsters are disobligingly distant, you can use missiles to weaken (or<br>
kill!) them from afar. You’ll find a variety of type, ranging from simple<br>
stones and piercing javelins to sophisticated darts covered in many types<br>
of poisons. Upon impact, missiles may become destroyed. The chance for this<br>
to occur depends on the type of missile.</p>
<p>The ‘F’ and ‘f’ commands can be used to throw a missile. The default type<br>
to be thrown (which ‘f’ will launch) is shown in the “quiver” display below<br>
your weapon. Many other items, spells, and abilities can fill this quiver<br>
as well.</p>
<p>See Appendix 5. “Inscriptions” for inscriptions which let you fine-tune the<br>
list of items to choose from. See also the Missiles section of<br>
options_guide.txt.</p>
<p>Use the ‘(’, ‘)’ to cycle through your quiver without firing, and ‘Q’ to<br>
choose a quivered item from a list. If you would like to choose something<br>
to fire without inserting it into the quiver, use ‘F’ instead.</p>
<p>The interface for shooting or throwing things is also used for evoking<br>
wands and casting certain spells, and is described in detail in section I<br>
(Targeting).</p>
<h1 id="armour">[ Armour</h1>
<p>This is also rather important. Most worn armour improves your Armour Class,<br>
which decreases the amount of damage you take from most types of injury.<br>
The heavier an armour is, the more AC (armour class) it will provide, at<br>
the expense of your EV (evasion) and stealth. Wearing heavy armour also<br>
increases your chances of miscasting spells and slow your attacks with<br>
missile weapons, effects which are only slightly reduced by your Armour<br>
skill. These penalties are larger if you have low Strength.</p>
<p>A shield normally increases neither your AC nor your evasion, but it lets<br>
you attempt to block melee attacks and some ranged attacks aimed at you.<br>
Wearing a shield (especially larger shields) slows your attacks, hampers<br>
your ability to cast spells, and lowers your evasion. Small species are<br>
more strongly affected by these penalties, and large species are less<br>
affected, but all species can reduce and eventually eliminate these<br>
penalties by mastering the Shields skill. You also obviously cannot wield a<br>
two-handed weapon while wearing a shield. Shields are most effective<br>
against the first attack on you each turn and become less useful for every<br>
one after that. There are three types: bucklers, kite shields, and tower<br>
shields, going from smallest to largest.</p>
<p>Some magical armours have special powers. These powers are sometimes<br>
automatic, affecting you whenever you wear the armour, and sometimes must<br>
be activated with the ‘a’ command.</p>
<p>You can wear armour with the ‘W’ command, and take it off with the ‘T’<br>
command. With ‘[’ you can have a quick look at your current gear.</p>
<p>Most armours can be improved by reading the appropriate scroll. Body armour<br>
and bardings can be enchanted up to the base value of AC they provide.<br>
Shields can be enchanted up to +3, +5, or +8, depending on their size.<br>
Other gear is limited to +2.</p>
<h1 id="magical-scrolls">? Magical Scrolls</h1>
<p>Scrolls have many different magical spells inscribed on them, some good and<br>
some bad. One of the most useful scrolls is the scroll of identify, which<br>
will tell you the function of any item you have in your inventory; you<br>
might want to save these up for items that are dangerous or wasteful to use<br>
when unidentified, such as potions or other scrolls. You can read scrolls<br>
(and by doing so invoke their magic) with the ‘r’ command.</p>
<h1 id="magical-potions">! Magical Potions</h1>
<p>While scrolls tend to affect your equipment or your environment, most<br>
potions affect your character in some way. The most common type is the<br>
simple curing potion, which restores some hit points and cures many<br>
ailments, but there are many other varieties of potions to be found.<br>
Potions can be quaffed (drunk) with the ‘q’ command.</p>
<h1 id="wands">/ Wands</h1>
<p>Sometimes you will be lucky enough to find a stick which contains stored<br>
magical energies. Wands each have a certain number of charges, which you<br>
immediately recognise when you pick them up. When you pick up a wand of<br>
type you already have in inventory, its charges are absorbed into the<br>
existing one. When a wand’s charges are fully depleted, it vanishes.</p>
<p>Wands are aimed in the same way as missile weapons, and you can release the<br>
power of a wand by evoking it with ‘V’. See section I for targeting.</p>
<p>Wands can be 'Q’uivered in order to shoot via the autofire or 'f’ire<br>
interface, like spells and ammo.</p>
<h1 id="rings-and-amulets">=" Rings and Amulets</h1>
<p>Magical rings are among the most useful of the items you will find in the<br>
dungeon. While equipped, they provide some kind of passive benefit to the<br>
wearer, such as increasing their attributes or providing various types of<br>
protection. Use the ‘P’ command to put on rings, and ‘R’ to remove them.<br>
You can wear up to two rings simultaneously, one on each hand; which hand<br>
you put a ring on is immaterial to its function. If you try to put on a<br>
ring while both ring fingers are full, you will be asked which one to<br>
remove. Octopodes are an exception, and may wear up to eight rings on their<br>
tentacles.</p>
<p>Amulets are similar to rings, but have different range of effects. Amulets<br>
are worn around the neck, and you can wear only one at a time. It is very<br>
quick to wear or remove a ring, but amulets’ magics make them cumbersome to<br>
put on or take off.</p>
<p>You can press ‘"’ to quickly check what jewellery you’re wearing.</p>
<h1 id="staves">| Staves</h1>
<p>There are a number of types of magical staves, each attuned to a different<br>
class of spells. While wielded they greatly increase the power of that<br>
class of spells. They can even be used in melee combat, although with<br>
mediocre effectiveness unless you can harness their special power, using a<br>
combination of the Evocations skill and the skill specific to the staff’s<br>
type.</p>
<h1 id="books">: Books</h1>
<p>Most books contain magical spells which your character may be able to<br>
learn. Upon picking up a book, all of the spells in it will be added to<br>
your spell library, allowing you to access a description of each spell or<br>
memorise spells from it with the ‘M’ command.</p>
<p>Occasionally you will find manuals of some skill. When you pick one up,<br>
your experience will have twice the usual effect when used for training<br>
that skill. Once a certain amount of bonus experience has been gained in<br>
this way, you will automatically discard the finished manual.</p>
<h1 id="miscellaneous">{ Miscellaneous</h1>
<p>These are items which don’t fall into any other category. They can be<br>
evoked with ‘V’, just like wands. Runes, a particular item in this<br>
category, have no function whatsoever except to open the endgame. You must<br>
collect at least three in order to enter the Realm of Zot. Some<br>
particularly cocky adventurers brag about having retrieved ten or even<br>
fifteen runes through their strength and cunning, but most scholars on the<br>
subject of Zot agree that such a thing is probably impossible in the first<br>
place, and secondly would be a meaningless achievement in any regard.</p>
<p>Miscellany can often be 'Q’uivered in order to shoot via the autofire or<br>
'f’ire interface, like spells and ammo.</p>
<h1 id="gold">$ Gold</h1>
<p>Gold can be used to buy items should you run across shops. There are also a<br>
few more esoteric uses for gold.</p>
<h1 id="artefacts">Artefacts</h1>
<p>Weapons, armour, jewellery and spellbooks can be artefacts. These come in<br>
two flavours: randomly created artefacts (‘randarts’) and predefined ones<br>
(‘unrandarts’). Randarts will always carry unusual names, such as “golden<br>
double sword” or “shimmering scale mail”. Artefacts cannot be modified in<br>
any way, including enchantments.</p>
<p>Apart from that, otherwise mundane items can get one special property.<br>
These are called ‘ego items’, and examples are: boots of flight, a weapon<br>
of flaming, a helmet of see invisible, and so on. Note that, unlike<br>
artefacts, such items can be modified by enchanting scrolls.</p>
<p>All ego items are noted with special adjectives but not all items noted in<br>
this way need have a special property (they often have some positive<br>
enchantment, instead):</p>
<p>:general: glowing, runed;<br>
:metal armours: shiny;<br>
:leather armours: dyed;<br>
:other armours: embroidered.</p>

<h2 id="h.------------------------------spellcasting">H.                              SPELLCASTING</h2>
<p>Magical spells are a very important part of surviving in the dungeon. Every<br>
character can make use of magical spells.</p>
<p>There are many skills related to magic, the principal one being<br>
Spellcasting. Spellcasting determines the number of Magic Points available;<br>
it also helps to cast any spell, though less so than schools associated<br>
with a spell. Next, there are several general magical schools (Conjuration,<br>
Hexes, Summoning, Necromancy, Translocation and Transmutation) as well as<br>
several elemental schools (Fire, Ice, Air and Earth) and, finally, Poison.<br>
A particular spell can belong to up to three schools. Being skilled in a<br>
spell’s schools improves the casting chance and the power of that spell.</p>
<p>Spells are stored in books, which you will occasionally find in the<br>
dungeon. Once you have picked up a book and added its contents to your<br>
spell library, you can memorise a spell using the ‘M’ command.</p>
<p>In addition to picking up new spells, your character may also wish to get<br>
rid of old ones by reading a scroll of amnesia, which will let you pick a<br>
spell to forget.</p>
<p>Each spell has a level. A spell’s level denotes the amount of skill<br>
required to use it, the MP cost of casting it, and indicates how powerful<br>
it may be. You can only memorise a certain number of levels of spells; type<br>
‘M’ to find out how many. When you gain experience levels or advance the<br>
Spellcasting skill, your maximum increases; you will need to save up for<br>
several levels to memorise the more powerful spells.</p>
<p>There are two ways to activate memorised spells: by “quivering” them and<br>
using the fire interface, or directly by pressing ‘z’ (for Zap). To choose<br>
a spell for the quiver, use ‘Q’, or ‘(’ and ‘)’ to cycle among possible<br>
actions. Press ‘f’ to enter the targeting interface, or shift-tab / ‘p’ to<br>
autofire a quivered spell at the nearest monster.</p>
<p>Use ‘I’ to display a list of all memorised spells without actually casting<br>
one. The spells available are labelled with letters; you are free to change<br>
this labelling with the ‘=’ command. You can assign both lowercase and<br>
uppercase letters to spells. Some spells, for example most damage dealing<br>
ones, require a target. See the next section for details on how to target.</p>
<p>Most spells have caps on their effects: no matter how intelligent and<br>
proficient you are, there is a limit to the damage you can achieve with a<br>
Magic Dart. In general, it is a good idea to look at the output of the ‘I’<br>
and ‘II’ screens to get a picture on your casting abilities. This is<br>
especially useful if you’re about to change armour or rings.</p>
<p>High level spells are difficult to cast, and you may miscast them every<br>
once in a while (resulting in a waste of magic and possibly dangerous<br>
side-effects). Your chance of failing to cast a spell properly depends on<br>
your skills, your intelligence, the level of the spell and whether you are<br>
wearing heavy armour. The chance of miscasting a spell is displayed on the<br>
spell screen, and coloured based on severity (yellow for moderate damage,<br>
light red for major damage, red for extreme damage, and magenta for<br>
potentially lethal damage).</p>
<p>Be careful of magic-using enemies! Some of them can use magic just as well<br>
as you, if not better, and often use it intelligently.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="i.--------------------------------targeting">I.                                TARGETING</h2>
<p>When throwing or firing something, evoking wands, or casting certain<br>
spells, you are asked for a direction. There are several ways to tell Crawl<br>
which monster to target.</p>
<p>You can press ‘?’ when asked for a direction; this will bring up a help<br>
screen. Otherwise, you use the following commands:</p>
<ul>
<li>The cursor will target on the monster which is closest to your position.<br>
Should you have been firing at something previously, with the offender<br>
still being in sight, the cursor will instead rest on the previous<br>
target.</li>
<li>Pressing ‘+’ or ‘=’ moves the cursor to the next monster, going from<br>
nearer to<br>
further away. Similarly, ‘-’ cycles backwards.</li>
<li>Any direction key moves the cursor by one square. Occasionally, it can be<br>
useful to target non-inhabited squares.</li>
<li>Targets can be selected from a list by pressing ‘Ctrl-X’.</li>
<li>When you are content with your choice of target, press one key of Enter,<br>
Del,<br>
or Space to fire at the target. If you press ‘.’, you also fire, but the<br>
spell/missile will stop at the target’s square if it misses. This can be<br>
useful to keep friendlies out of the fire, or to make sure your precious<br>
missiles won’t end up in deep water.</li>
<li>You can press Escape if you changed your mind - no turns are deducted.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some shortcuts while targeting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Typing Shift-direction on your keypad fires straight away in that<br>
direction. - Pressing ‘p’ or ‘f’ fires at the previous target (if it is<br>
still alive and in<br>
sight). Due to this, most hunters can go a long way by pressing ‘vf’ to<br>
fire their ammunition at a monster and then keep firing at it with<br>
further ‘vf’ strokes. At times, it will be useful to switch targets with<br>
the ‘+’ or ‘-’ commands, though.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you target yourself while firing something harmful (which can be<br>
sensible at times), you will be asked for confirmation.</p>
<p>Finally, the ‘:’ key allows you to hide the path of your<br>
spell/wand/missile.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="j.--------------------------------religion">J.                                RELIGION</h2>
<p>There are a number of gods, demons and other assorted powers who will<br>
accept your character’s worship, and sometimes give out favours in<br>
exchange. You can use the ‘^’ command to check the requirements of whoever<br>
it is that you worship, and if you find religion to be an inconvenience you<br>
can always renounce your faith (use the ‘a’ command - but most gods resent<br>
being scorned). Further details can be seen with ‘!’ while in the ‘^’<br>
screen.</p>
<p>To use any powers which your god deems you fit for, access the abilities<br>
menu via the ‘a’ command; god-given abilities are listed as invocations.<br>
Many god abilities can be 'Q’uivered in order to trigger via the 'f’ire or<br>
autofire interface.</p>
<p>Depending on background, some characters start out religious; others have<br>
to pray at an altar to dedicate themselves to a life of servitude. There<br>
are altars scattered all over the dungeon, and there are rumours of a<br>
special temple somewhere near the surface.</p>
<p>At an altar, you can enter a god’s service by pressing &lt; or &gt;. You’ll first<br>
be given a description of the god, and then be asked if you really want to<br>
join. To see a list of the standard gods and which of their altars you’ve<br>
seen in your current game, press ‘Ctrl-O’. You can also learn about all<br>
gods by pressing ‘?/G’.</p>
<p>Note that some gods are picky about who can enter their service; for<br>
example, good gods will not accept demonic or undead devotees.</p>
<p>If you would like to start the game with a religion, choose your background<br>
from Berserker, Chaos Knight, Abyssal Knight or Cinder Acolyte.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="k.--------------------------------mutations">K.                                MUTATIONS</h2>
<p>The Dungeon contains many sources of mutagenic radiation and magical<br>
contamination, which may cause your character to gain semi-permanent<br>
mutations if affected. You can use the ‘A’ command to view a list of any<br>
mutations that you have acquired. Individual mutations can be examined in<br>
further detail by pressing the letter they are labelled with.</p>
<p>Many mutations are actually beneficial to your character, but there are<br>
plenty of nasty ones as well. Some mutations have multiple levels, each of<br>
which counts as a single mutation.</p>
<p>Miscasting spells will cause magical contamination, which in turn can cause<br>
mutations if too much contamination is accrued at once. Certain powerful<br>
magical effects or spells (such as ‘Invisibility’ and ‘Irradiate’) also<br>
cause contamination as a side-effect even when successful. A single use of<br>
these effects is safe on its own, but multiple uses in short succession, or<br>
usage with existing contamination from other sources can cause dangerous<br>
levels of contamination.</p>
<p>Mutations from magical contamination are almost always harmful. Mutations<br>
can also be caused by specific potions or by spells cast by powerful<br>
enemies found deep in the dungeon.</p>
<p>It is more difficult to get rid of bad mutations than to get one. Using<br>
potions of mutation will remove a number of your current mutations, but<br>
will give you more mutations. These might be better to your taste. However,<br>
the only sure-fire ways is to join the gods Zin or Jiyva, each of whom<br>
provides some remedy against mutations.</p>
<p>Demonspawn are a special case. Characters of this species get certain<br>
special mutations as they gain levels; these are listed in cyan. They are<br>
permanent and can never be removed. If one of your Demonspawn powers has<br>
been augmented by a random mutation, it is displayed in a lighter colour.</p>
<p>Many a species starts with some special intrinsic features, like the<br>
greater speed of Felids or Spriggans, or the claws of Trolls and Ghouls.<br>
These are often, but not always, like a preset mutation. In case such an<br>
innate feature gets amplified by an ordinary mutation, it is displayed in a<br>
light blue colour. Some of these innate features will provide an activated<br>
ability, which can be used with the ‘a’ command.</p>
<p>Some mutations are only temporary and will dissipate after slaying more<br>
enemies. These are listed in purple on the list of mutations, and marked as<br>
temporary.</p>

<h1 id="history">History</h1>
<p>Crawl began as Linley’s Dungeon Crawl, created in 1995 by Linley Henzell.<br>
Linley based Crawl on popular roguelikes of the time, namely Moria, Hack,<br>
and NetHack, also taking inspiration from traditional RPGs like Ultima IV.<br>
The object of your quest in Crawl, the Orb of Zot, was taken from Wizard’s<br>
Castle, a text adventure written in BASIC.</p>
<p>Linley produced Crawl versions up to 3.30, released in March 1999. Further<br>
work was then carried out by a group of developers who released 3.40 in<br>
February 2000. Of these developers, Brent Ross emerged as the single<br>
maintainer, producing versions until 4.0 beta 26 in 2002. Brent released an<br>
alpha version 4.1 in August 2005, which vastly overhauled the codebase and<br>
reworked many of the game’s aspects, but also considerably increased its<br>
difficulty. By this point, Brent no longer had enough free time to develop<br>
Crawl. Hence Darshan Shaligram, who had previously contributed many UI<br>
improvements, recruited longtime player Erik Piper to start a new project<br>
and continue development.</p>
<p>Darshan and Erik aimed to incorporate ideas from the 4.1 alpha and produce<br>
a more balanced an enjoyable game. Calling their project “Dungeon Crawl:<br>
Stone Soup” in reference to their collaborative process, they pulled many<br>
4.1 improvements into the 4.0 beta 26 codebase, play-testing and adjusting<br>
the results. Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup version 0.1 was released to USENET<br>
in September 2006, with many additional developers subsequently joining the<br>
team. See Darshan’s own account of the project’s creation here:</p>
<p><a href="https://crawl.develz.org/wordpress/the-dawn-of-stone-soup">https://crawl.develz.org/wordpress/the-dawn-of-stone-soup</a></p>
<p>The development of Crawl proceeds to this day, with a team of many<br>
developers and hundreds of contributors.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="m.----------------------macros-options-performance">M.                      MACROS, OPTIONS, PERFORMANCE</h2>
<p>Crawl supports redefining keys via key maps. This is useful when your<br>
keyboard layout makes some key awkward to use. You can also define macros:<br>
these are command sequences which can make playing a great deal more<br>
convenient. Note that mapping ‘a’ to some other key will treat almost all<br>
pressings of ‘a’ in that new way (including dropping and wielding, etc.),<br>
so is not recommended. Macroing ‘a’ to some other key will only change the<br>
command key ‘a’.</p>
<p>You can set up key maps and macros in-game with the ‘~’ key (‘Ctrl-D’ will<br>
also work); this also allows for saving all current key bindings and<br>
macros. Alternatively, you can directly edit the macro.txt file. For more<br>
information on both and for examples, see macros_guide.txt.</p>
<p>Crawl supports a large number of options that allow for great flexibility<br>
in the interface. They are fully documented in the file options_guide.txt.<br>
The options themselves are set in the file ~/.crawlrc (for UNIX systems -<br>
copy over init.txt to ~/.crawlrc) or init.txt (for Windows).</p>
<p>Several interface routines are outsourced to external Lua scripts. The<br>
standard distribution has them in the dat/clua/ directory. Have a look at<br>
the single scripts for short descriptions.</p>
<p>Generally, Crawl should run swiftly on all machines (it compiles out of the<br>
box for Linux, Windows, OS X, and, to some lesser extent, other Unices).<br>
If, for some reason, you find Crawl runs unacceptably slowly on your<br>
machine, there are a few measures which may improve the situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>set travel_delay = -1 to avoid screen redraws during travel (this might<br>
be<br>
especially useful if playing on a remote server)</li>
<li>try playing in console mode rather than tiles</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="n.-------------------------philosophy-pas-de-faq">N.                         PHILOSOPHY (PAS DE FAQ)</h2>
<p>In a nutshell: This game aims to be a tactical fantasy-themed dungeon<br>
crawl. We strive for strategy being a concern, too, and for exquisite<br>
gameplay and interface. However, don’t expect plots or quests.</p>
<p>You may ponder about the wisdom of certain design decisions of Crawl. This<br>
section tries to explain some of them. It could also be of interest if you<br>
are used to other roguelikes and want a bit of background on the<br>
differences. Prime mainstays of Crawl development are the following, most<br>
of which are explained in more detail below. Note that many of these date<br>
back to Linley’s first versions.</p>
<p>Major design goals</p>
<ul>
<li>challenging and random gameplay, with skill making a real difference</li>
<li>meaningful decisions (no no-brainers)</li>
<li>avoidance of grinding (no scumming)</li>
<li>gameplay supporting painless interface and newbie support</li>
</ul>
<p>Minor design goals</p>
<ul>
<li>clarity (playability without need for spoilers)</li>
<li>internal consistency</li>
<li>replayability (using branches, species, playing styles and gods)</li>
<li>proper use of out of depth monsters</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="balance">Balance</h1>
<p>The notions of balance, or being imbalanced, are extremely vague. Here is<br>
our definition: Crawl is designed to be a challenging game, and is also<br>
renowned for its randomness. However, this does not mean that wins are an<br>
arbitrary matter of luck: the skill of players will have the largest<br>
impact. So, yes, there may be situations where you are doomed - no action<br>
could have saved your life. But then, from the midgame on, most deaths are<br>
not of this type: By this stage, almost all casualties can be traced back<br>
to actual mistakes; if not tactical ones, then of a strategical type, like<br>
wrong skilling (too broad or too narrow), unwise use of resources (too<br>
conservative or too liberal), or wrong decisions about branch/god/gear.</p>
<p>The possibility of unavoidable deaths is a larger topic in computer games.<br>
Ideally, a game like this would be really challenging and have both random<br>
layout and random course of action, yet still be winnable with perfect<br>
play. This goal seems out of reach. Thus, computer games can be soft in the<br>
sense that optimal play ensures a win. Apart from puzzles, though, this<br>
means that the game is solved from the outset; this is where the lack of a<br>
human game-master is obvious. Alternatively, they can be hard in the sense<br>
that unavoidable deaths can occur. We feel that the latter choice provides<br>
much more fun in the long run.</p>
<p>Crawl has a huge number of handmade vaults/maps to tweak the randomness.<br>
While the placement, and often parts of the contents, of such vaults are<br>
random as well, they provide several advantages: vaults offer challenges<br>
that are very hard to get via just random monster and layout generation;<br>
they may centre on some theme, providing additional immersion; finally,<br>
they will often contain some loot, forcing players to decide between safety<br>
and greed.</p>
<p>(The next topic can also be filed under balance; see Replayability for what<br>
balance does not mean to us.)</p>
<h1 id="crusade-against-no-brainers">Crusade against no-brainers</h1>
<p>A very important point in Crawl is steering away from no-brainers. Speaking<br>
about games in general, wherever there’s a no-brainer, that means the<br>
development team put a lot of effort into providing a “choice” that’s<br>
really not an interesting choice at all. And that’s a horrible lost<br>
opportunity for fun. Examples for this are the resistances: there are very<br>
few permanent sources, most involve a choice (like rings or specific<br>
armour) or are only semi-permanent (like mutations). Another example is the<br>
absence of clear-cut best items, which comes from the fact that most<br>
artefacts are randomly generated. Furthermore, even non-random artefacts<br>
cannot be wished for, as scrolls of acquirement produce random items in<br>
general. Likewise, there are no sure-fire means of life saving (the closest<br>
equivalents are scrolls of blinking, and good religious standings for some<br>
deities).</p>
<h1 id="anti-grinding">Anti-grinding</h1>
<p>Another basic design principle is avoidance of grinding (also known as<br>
scumming). These are activities that have low risk, take a lot of time, and<br>
bring some reward. This is bad for a game’s design because it encourages<br>
players to bore themselves. Even worse, it may be optimal to do so. We try<br>
to avoid this!</p>
<p>This explains why shops don’t buy: otherwise players would hoover the<br>
dungeon for items to sell. Not messing with lighting also falls into this<br>
category: there might be a benefit to mood when players have to carry<br>
candles/torches, but we don’t see any gameplay benefit. The deep tactical<br>
gameplay Crawl aims for necessitates permanent dungeon levels. Many a time<br>
characters have to choose between descending or battling. While caution is<br>
a virtue in Crawl, as it is in many other roguelikes, there are strong<br>
forces driving characters deeper.</p>
<h1 id="interface">Interface</h1>
<p>The interface is radically designed to make gameplay easy - this sounds<br>
trivial, but we mean it. All tedious, but necessary, chores should be<br>
automated. Examples are long-distance travel, exploration and taking notes.<br>
Also, we try to cater for different preferences: both ASCII and tiles are<br>
supported; as are vi-keys and numpad. Documentation is plenty,<br>
context-specific and always available in-game. Finally, we ease getting<br>
started via tutorials.</p>
<h1 id="clarity">Clarity</h1>
<p>Things ought to work in an intuitive way. Crawl definitely is winnable<br>
without spoiler access. Concerning important but hidden details (i.e. facts<br>
subject to spoilers) our policy is this: the joy of discovering something<br>
spoily is nice, once. (And disappears before it can start if you feel you<br>
need to read spoilers - a legitimate feeling.) The joy of dealing with<br>
ever-changing, unexpected and challenging strategic and tactical situations<br>
that arise out of transparent rules, on the other hand, is nice again and<br>
again. That said, we believe that qualitative feedback is often better than<br>
precise numbers.</p>
<p>In concrete terms, we either spell out a gameplay mechanic explicitly<br>
(either in the manual, or by in-game feedback) or leave it to min-maxers if<br>
we feel that the naive approach is good enough.</p>
<h1 id="consistency">Consistency</h1>
<p>While there is no plot to speak of, the game should still be set in a<br>
consistent Crawl universe. For example, names of artefacts should fit the<br>
mood, vaults should be sensibly placed and monsters should somehow fit as<br>
well. Essentially, this is about player immersion. As such, it’s good to<br>
have in mind, but consistency is always secondary to gameplay. A typical<br>
example is player vs. monster behaviour: while we try to make these<br>
identical (or similar), there are good reasons for keeping them distinct in<br>
certain cases.</p>
<h1 id="replayability">Replayability</h1>
<p>This is actually quite important, but in some sense just a corollary to the<br>
major design goals. Besides these, there are several other points helping<br>
to make playing Crawl fun over and over again:</p>
<p>Diversity<br>
whenever there are choices to the player, be that choice of species, god,<br>
weapon or spell, the various options should be genuinely different. It is<br>
no good to provide dozens of weapons with different names (and perhaps<br>
even numbers) if, in the end, they all play the same.</p>
<p>Many different species<br>
This is partly due to the skills and aptitude system. Similarly important<br>
are the built-in starting bonuses/handicaps of species; these often have<br>
great impact on play. To us, balance does not mean that all combinations<br>
of background and species play equally well! Some are much more<br>
challenging than others, and this is fine with us. Each species has at<br>
least some backgrounds playing rather well, though.</p>
<p>Dungeon layout<br>
Even veteran players may find the Tomb or the Hells exciting (which are<br>
designed such that life endangering situations can always pop up). These<br>
and other branches may or may not fit a given character’s buildup. By the<br>
way, we strongly believe that games are pointless if you can reach the<br>
invincible state.</p>
<p>Religion<br>
This addresses new players, as getting to the Temple and choosing a god<br>
becomes the first major task of most games. But religion is also a point<br>
in favour of replayability for experienced players, since the choice of<br>
god can matter as much as species does.</p>
<p>Playing styles<br>
Related to, but encompassing, species, background, god are fundamentally<br>
different playing styles like melee oriented fighter, stabber, etc.<br>
Deciding on whether (and when!) to make a transition of style can make or<br>
break games.</p>
<h1 id="out-of-the-depths">Out of the depths</h1>
<p>From time to time a discussion about Crawl’s unfair OOD (out of depth)<br>
monsters turns up, like a dragon on the second dungeon level. These are not<br>
bugs! Actually, they are part of the randomness design goal. In this case,<br>
they also serve as additional motivation: in many situations, the OOD<br>
monster can be survived somehow, and the mental bond with the character<br>
will then surely grow. OOD monsters also help to keep players on their toes<br>
by making shallow levels still not trivial. In a similar vein, early trips<br>
to the Abyss are not deficits: there’s more than one way out, and<br>
successfully escaping is exciting for anyone.</p>

<pre><code>                   LIST OF CHARACTER SPECIES
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Species are categorised, roughly, by how difficult and complex they are to<br>
learn how to play, into three categories: <em>Simple</em>, <em>Intermediate</em>, and<br>
<em>Advanced</em>. These categories do not necessarily align with difficulty for<br>
an experienced Crawl player, but rather are intended as an indication of to<br>
what degree a species has unusual or complex mechanics, or requires<br>
deeper/wider knowledge of how the game works. (For example, Djinn have one<br>
of the higher win rates of all species, but are classified as<br>
“Intermediate” because their no-mp/no-books mechanic takes some adapting<br>
to, and has non-trivial interactions with background and god choice.)<br>
Despite being the outcome of a discussion among many players, these<br>
categorizations definitely have a subjective element to them, and you<br>
shouldn’t take them to be limiting!</p>
<p>The order within categories is also, roughly, determined by our best<br>
judgment about the relative ease of learning to play each species.</p>
<p>Next to each species name, in parentheses, is the canonical abbreviation<br>
for the species.</p>
<p>Note:  Use ‘A’ to check for which particular peculiarities a species might<br>
have. Also, some species have special abilities which can be<br>
accessed by the ‘a’ abilities menu. Some also have physical<br>
characteristics which allow them to make extra attacks.</p>
<p>Note:  Humans are a useful reference point when considering other species:<br>
they have 0 for almost all aptitudes; have no special abilities,<br>
weakness, or constraints against using certain types of<br>
equipment; move normally; and gain experience and willpower at a<br>
“typical” rate. However, you will see that they are categorised<br>
as an <em>Intermediate</em> species – because they are decent, but not<br>
excellent, at nearly everything, a Human may need to make use of<br>
all sorts of game mechanics depending on what they find in the<br>
dungeon, and know how to defend itself against any type of damage<br>
or attack it encounters.</p>
<h1 id="simple-species">Simple species</h1>
<p>Species categorised as <em>Simple</em> work straightforwardly for players who have<br>
less experience with Crawl’s game mechanics. While many do have quirks,<br>
these quirks tend to be passive traits that simplify gameplay, rather than<br>
challenges that a player has to consciously work around. While all of these<br>
species do have weaknesses of some kind, these weaknesses are simple to<br>
understand, aren’t fundamentally crippling to all members of the species,<br>
and are balanced by other strengths. In many cases the special properties<br>
of these species allow the player to set aside many aspects of the game<br>
while still developing a strong character.</p>
<p>Hill Orcs (HO)<br>
Hill Orcs are Orcs from the upper world who, jealous of the riches which<br>
their cousins (the Cave Orcs) possess below the ground, descend in search<br>
of plunder and adventure.</p>
<p>Hill Orcs are strong and robust. Their forte is brute-force fighting, and<br>
they are skilled at using most hand weapons (particularly axes, with<br>
which they are experts), though they are not particularly good at using<br>
missile weapons. Hill Orcs are passable users of most types of magic and<br>
are particularly skilled with fire.</p>
<p>Hill Orcs have a strong connection to the gods and learn Invocations very<br>
quickly. The Orc god Beogh is worshipped only by Orcs, and the orc<br>
priests of the Dungeon preach that Beogh is indeed the only true god.<br>
Hill Orcs may convert to Beogh even without an altar whenever an orc<br>
priest is in sight.</p>
<p>Minotaurs (Mi)<br>
The Minotaurs are a species of hybrids, posessing human bodies with<br>
bovine heads. They delve into the Dungeon because of their instinctive<br>
love of twisting passageways.</p>
<p>Minotaurs are extremely good at all forms of physical combat, but are<br>
awful at using any type of magic. They can wear all armour except for<br>
some headgear. When in close combat, Minotaurs are able to reflexively<br>
headbutt those who dare attack them.</p>
<p>Merfolk (Mf)<br>
The Merfolk are a hybrid species of half-human, half-fish that typically<br>
live in the oceans and rivers, seldom venturing toward land. However,<br>
Merfolk aren’t as limited on land as some myths suggest; their tails will<br>
quickly reform into legs once they leave the water (and, likewise, their<br>
legs will quickly reform into a tail should they ever enter water). They<br>
tend to be surprisingly nimble on land as well as in the water. Experts<br>
at swimming, they need not fear drowning and move very quickly through<br>
water.</p>
<p>The Merfolk have developed their martial arts strongly on thrusting and<br>
grappling, since those are the most efficient ways to fight underwater.<br>
They therefore prefer polearms and short swords above all other weapons,<br>
though they can also use longer swords quite well.</p>
<p>As spellcasters, they tend to be quite good in specific areas. Their<br>
mystical relationship with water makes it easier for them to use poison<br>
and ice magic, which use water occasionally as a material component. The<br>
legendary water magic of the Merfolk was lost in ancient times, but some<br>
of that affinity still remains. The instability of their own morphogenic<br>
matrix has made them very accomplished transmuters, but most other magic<br>
seems foreign to them.</p>
<p>Palentongas (Pa)<br>
The Palentongas are a large, scaled mammalian species, walking on four<br>
feet and swinging a powerful tail behind them. Their elephant-back armies<br>
terrorize the lands outside the Dungeon.</p>
<p>Palentongas are best known for their powerful roll attack, curling up and<br>
rolling into a crashing melee attack against nearby foes. They’re well<br>
suited to melee combat and to casting supportive spells, but they’re<br>
significantly worse at other forms of combat and advance quite slowly in<br>
experience levels. Their body shape reduces the protection given by the<br>
body armour they wear.</p>
<p>Gargoyles (Gr)<br>
A cross between ordinary stone gargoyles and living beings, Gargoyles are<br>
hideous humanoids with an affinity to rock. They have low health, but<br>
large amounts of innate armour which increases further as they gain<br>
levels. They eventually gain the ability to fly.</p>
<p>Gargoyles’ partially living form grants them immunity to poison, as well<br>
as resistance to electricity, and protection from some effects of<br>
necromancy. Their natural armour makes them strong melee fighters, and<br>
they are naturally skilled with blunt weapons and in unarmed combat. They<br>
can also be exceptional earth-based conjurers.</p>
<p>Draconians (Dr)<br>
Draconians are human-dragon hybrids: humanoid in form and approximately<br>
human-sized, with wings, tails and scaly skins. Draconians start out in<br>
an immature form with brown scales, but as they grow in power they take<br>
on a variety of colours. This happens at an early stage in their career,<br>
and the colour is determined by chromosomes, not by behaviour.</p>
<p>Most types of Draconians have breath weapons or special resistances.<br>
Draconians cannot wear body armour and advance very slowly in levels, but<br>
are reasonably good at all skills other than missile weapons, and they<br>
develop natural physical defenses that compensate for the lack of body<br>
armour, without needing to train their Armour skill at all. Still, each<br>
colour has its own strengths and some have complementary weaknesses,<br>
which sometimes requires a bit of flexibility on the part of the player.<br>
They are good general-purpose spellcasters, and typically their<br>
spellcasting aptitudes will adapt slightly when they gain a colour.</p>
<p>Draconian colours are detailed below, in the subsection titled<br>
“Draconian types”.</p>
<p>Trolls (Tr)<br>
Trolls are monstrous creatures with powerful claws. They have thick,<br>
knobbly skins of any colour from putrid green to mucky brown, which are<br>
covered in patches of thick fur.</p>
<p>They are incredibly strong, and regenerate rapidly from even the most<br>
terrible wounds. However, they are hopeless at spellcasting and learn<br>
most skills very slowly. Their large size prevents them from wearing most<br>
forms of armour.</p>
<p>Ghouls (Gh)<br>
Ghouls are horrible undead creatures that sleep in their graves for years<br>
on end, only to rise and stalk the living. Slain foes heal these<br>
monstrous beings as they feast on the macabre energies released.</p>
<p>They learn most skills slowly, although they make decent unarmed fighters<br>
with their claws. Due to their contact with the grave they can also learn<br>
to use ice, earth, poison and necromantic magic without too many<br>
difficulties.</p>
<p>Like other undead, ghouls are naturally immune to poisons, negative<br>
energy and torment; have little warmth left to be affected by cold; and<br>
are not susceptible to mutations.</p>
<p>Gnolls (Gn)<br>
Gnolls are a species of caniform humanoids originally hailing from the<br>
arid deserts and grasslands of the east. In recent history they have<br>
become unusually attracted to the Dungeon, establishing tribes around and<br>
even inside of it. Unfortunately their long stay in the Dungeon has<br>
exposed their somewhat fragile minds to excessive amounts of its magic.</p>
<p>On the one hand, their bizarrely altered brains now have incredible<br>
proficiency at learning every skill. On the other, these same alterations<br>
have rendered Gnolls incapable of selective learning. They learn all<br>
skills at the same time, so are generally unable to specialise in any one<br>
thing.</p>
<p>In order to survive with this limitation, Gnolls use their universal<br>
knowledge to take advantage of every resource they find in the Dungeon.<br>
They also have powerful noses adapted to the Dungeon’s scents, allowing<br>
them to easily locate where treasures lay hidden.</p>
<h1 id="intermediate-species">Intermediate Species</h1>
<p>Species classified as <em>Intermediate</em> require a broader understanding of the<br>
mechanics of Crawl, have some weakness(es) that must be actively<br>
compensated for, and/or add a relatively complex mechanic (or change in<br>
mechanic) to gameplay.</p>
<p>Humans (Hu)<br>
Humans tend to be hardworking and industrious, and learn new things<br>
quickly. The Human species is the most versatile of all the species<br>
available to players. Humans advance quickly in levels and have equal<br>
abilities in most skills.</p>
<p>Kobolds (Ko)<br>
Kobolds are small, mysterious creatures of unknown origin. They are well<br>
suited to lurking in the darkness of the Dungeon, and have a reduced<br>
range of vision which also reduces the range at which they can be seen by<br>
enemies.</p>
<p>They are competent in combat, especially with short blades, maces or<br>
crossbows, and are comfortable with all forms of magic. They are also<br>
very adept at using magical devices. Their small size makes them unable<br>
to wield large weapons, but they are agile and stealthy, and advance in<br>
levels as quickly as Humans.</p>
<p>Demonspawn (Ds)<br>
Demonspawn are horrible half-mortal, half-infernal creatures. Demonspawn<br>
can be created in any number of ways: magical experiments, breeding,<br>
unholy pacts, etc. Although many Demonspawn may initially be<br>
indistinguishable from those of pure mortal stock, they will inevitably<br>
grow horns, scales or other unusual features. Powerful members of this<br>
class of beings also develop a range of unholy abilities, which are<br>
listed as mutations.</p>
<p>Demonspawn advance slowly in experience and learn most skills slightly<br>
slower than Humans, although they are talented at some forms of magic.<br>
They learn Invocations especially quickly, although the good gods will<br>
not accept their worship due to their unholy nature.</p>
<p>Djinn (Dj)<br>
Djinn are beings of smokeless fire. They enter the world spontaneously<br>
and without explanation, born with a tireless hunger for knowledge and<br>
adventure. Djinn have a unique relationship with magic: rather than<br>
learning spells from books, their spells come from within, welling up<br>
from their fiery core as they gain experience. They draw from that same<br>
fiery core to cast spells - for Djinn, magical power and health are one<br>
and the same.</p>
<p>As elemental beings, Djinn are immune to poison and highly resistant to<br>
fire, though cold damage is deeply inimical to them. Since they float<br>
through the air without need for legs or feet, they cannot wear boots.</p>
<p>Djinn are middlingly competent at most forms of physical combat, but have<br>
a particular aptitude for spellcasting. Their Spellcasting skill grants<br>
the same level of spell success and power that other species need<br>
multiple skills to reach.</p>
<p>Spriggans (Sp)<br>
Spriggans are small magical creatures distantly related to Elves. They<br>
love to frolic and cast mischievous spells.</p>
<p>They are poor fighters and have little physical resilience, but they move<br>
extremely quickly and stealthily, and are incredible at dodging attacks.<br>
They are terrible at destructive magic - conjurations, summonings,<br>
necromancy and elemental spells. On the other hand, they are excellent at<br>
other forms of magic and at evoking magical items. Their size makes them<br>
unable to wear most armour. They cannot wield large weapons, and even<br>
most smaller weapons require both hands to be wielded by a Spriggan.</p>
<p>Tengu (Te)<br>
The Tengu are an ancient and feared species of bird-people with a<br>
legendary propensity for violence. Basically humanoid with bird-like<br>
heads and clawed feet, the Tengu can wear all types of armour except<br>
helmets and boots. Despite their lack of wings, powerful Tengu can fly<br>
magically, and their movement speed and evasion are increased slightly<br>
while flying.</p>
<p>They are experts at all forms of fighting, including the magical arts of<br>
combat (conjurations, summonings and, to a lesser extent, necromancy).<br>
They are good at air and fire elemental magic, but poor at ice and earth<br>
magic. Tengu do not appreciate any form of servitude, and so are poor at<br>
using invocations. Their light avian bodies cannot sustain a great deal<br>
of injury.</p>
<p>Deep Elves (DE)<br>
The Deep Elves are a species of Elves who long ago fled the overworld to<br>
live in darkness underground. There, they developed their mental powers,<br>
evolving a natural gift for all forms of magic, and adapted physically<br>
to their new environment, becoming weaker and losing all colouration.<br>
They are poor at melee combat and physical defense, although they are<br>
capable at using bows in ranged combat.</p>
<p>Ogres (Og)<br>
Ogres are huge, chunky creatures who are very strong and robust, but are<br>
not nimble at all. They possess a raw talent for magic, but are poor at<br>
making use of magical devices. Ogres mature almost as quickly as Humans.</p>
<p>Their preferred methods of avoiding beatings are dodging and the use of<br>
shields. Their large size prevents them from wearing most forms of<br>
armour. Ogres are proficient at using all types of melee weapons, but all<br>
sophisticated forms of missile combat are awkward for them. They are,<br>
however, good at throwing things, in particular boulders.</p>
<p>Meteorae (Me)<br>
Meteorae are the people of the heavens, fallen to earth. They possess<br>
exceptional skills, an uncanny sense for the space around them, and the<br>
ability to recover health and magic as they explore the dungeon. However,<br>
as creatures clearly not native to the world, they are easy prey for the<br>
dark forces that hunt adventurers - they have one-tenth as much time as<br>
normal before Zot finds them. (See the section on ‘Zot’ for more.)</p>
<h1 id="advanced-species">Advanced Species</h1>
<p><em>Advanced</em> species have some substantial weaknesses, and/or add multiple<br>
complex new mechanics to gameplay. This category includes several species<br>
that experienced players may not find difficult per se, but that may<br>
require quite a bit of experience to adapt to. It also includes species<br>
that are just plain difficult, such as Mummies.</p>
<p>Vine Stalkers (VS)<br>
Limber in shape, Vine Stalkers are anthropomorphic masses of thick vines.<br>
They possess a once-humanoid core, parasitised moments before death by<br>
the magical vines. Lacking any other discernible features, their faces<br>
are dominated by the disproportionate, vicious maw with which they<br>
disrupt and devour the magical energies of their foes.</p>
<p>Magic courses freely through their bodies, and any damage they take is<br>
split between their health and magical reserves. They also physically<br>
regenerate at an alarming rate. However these traits come at a price: the<br>
dual nature of their bodies makes them extremely frail, and they cannot<br>
benefit from potions to heal their wounds.</p>
<p>Living examples of adaptation, Vine Stalkers level up quickly and lend<br>
well to an all-out offensive style; trusting their stealth to choose<br>
their prey and then their regenerating capabilities to power through the<br>
wounds they may sustain in battle. Many members of the species however,<br>
are seen wielding magic quite competently and then switching to a hybrid<br>
style when their reserves start to run low, thus replenishing their<br>
shroud of magic and their spells’ fuel with each voracious bite.</p>
<p>Vampires (Vp)<br>
Vampires are an undead species, with the ability to shift between<br>
bloodless and alive forms at will. Bloodless Vampires can heal themselves<br>
by drinking the blood of the living in combat, and have the traits of the<br>
undead (immunity to poisons, negative energy and torment, and resistance<br>
to damage from cold), but are much less resilient and cannot regenerate<br>
health when monsters are in sight. On the other hand, a Vampire full with<br>
blood will regenerate very quickly, but will lose all undead powers. Upon<br>
growing, they learn to transform from their bloodless form into a<br>
fast-moving bat. Unlike other undead species, they may be mutated<br>
normally at all times.</p>
<p>Demigods (Dg)<br>
Demigods are mortals with some divine or angelic ancestry, however<br>
distant. Demigods look more or less like members of their mortal part’s<br>
species, but they are extremely robust and can draw on great supplies of<br>
magical energy. They are able to sculpt their attributes to a far greater<br>
extent than any other species, gaining substantial boosts to their choice<br>
of Strength, Intelligence or Dexterity as they gain experience. On the<br>
downside, they advance more slowly in experience than any other species,<br>
gain skills slightly less quickly than Humans and, due to their status,<br>
refuse to worship any god.</p>
<p>Formicids (Fo)<br>
The Formicids are a species of humanoid ants. Just like their tiny insect<br>
ancestors, the Formicids are well adept at earth work, both on the<br>
physical and magical sides. Their abilities have been used to tunnel<br>
immense underground communities and structures, many of which are tens of<br>
thousands of years old.</p>
<p>Perhaps unfortunately, their strong ties to earth have left them<br>
completely impervious to being teleported or hasted; Formicids are tied<br>
to the earth with a complete sense of stasis. While this is a seemingly<br>
bad property for a dungeon adventurer, stasis has the beneficial effect<br>
of preventing many types of nasty hexes and maledictions.</p>
<p>With the ability to lift ten times their own weight, the Formicids have<br>
strength rivaling that of Ogres. This, along with the fact that they have<br>
four arms, allows Formicid warriors to equip both a shield and a<br>
two-handed weapon at the same time.</p>
<p>Formicids make good earth and venom mages, but are quite capable at both<br>
melee and ranged combat too. They are naturally bad at air magic and<br>
conjurations.</p>
<p>Nagas (Na)<br>
Nagas are a hybrid species: Human from the waist up with a large snake<br>
tail instead of legs.</p>
<p>They are reasonably good at most things and advance in experience levels<br>
slightly slower than Humans. They are naturally resistant to poisons, can<br>
see invisible creatures, and have tough skin, but their tails are<br>
relatively slow and cannot move them around as quickly as can other<br>
creatures’ legs (this only affects their movement rate; all other actions<br>
are at normal speed). Like Palentongas, their body shape also prevents<br>
them from gaining full protection from body armour. A Naga’s biggest<br>
forte is stealth: Nagas are very good at moving unnoticed. Their tails<br>
eventually grow strong enough to constrict their foes in combat.</p>
<p>Nagas can spit poison; the accuracy and damage of this poison increases<br>
with the Naga’s experience level.</p>
<p>Octopodes (Op)<br>
These land-capable relatives of common octopuses can move about as fast<br>
as humans and yet retain the ability to swim underwater, although their<br>
dual adaptation is not as good as that of the shapechanging Merfolk.</p>
<p>Octopodes have eight tentacle-shaped legs, and need four of them to move.<br>
While a tentacle lacks fingers, two tentacles are a rough equivalent of a<br>
human’s arm where item manipulation is concerned - including wielding<br>
two-handed weapons with four. They can use no armour other than loose<br>
hats, but can handle shields just fine. Another peculiarity they have is<br>
the ability to wear eight rings, one on each tentacle.</p>
<p>Their natural camouflage makes them excel at stealth, and they have good<br>
knowledge of poisons as well. They are also able to use their tentacles<br>
to constrict enemies - potentially several at a time!</p>
<p>Felids (Fe)<br>
Felids are a breed of cats that have been granted sentience. Originally<br>
they were witches’ familiars that were magically augmented to provide<br>
help for their masters’ rituals, yet many have abandoned, outlived, or,<br>
in at least one case, eviscerated their former masters and gone out into<br>
the world.</p>
<p>While fully capable of using speech and most forms of magic, Felids are<br>
at a serious disadvantage due to their inability to use armour or<br>
weapons.</p>
<p>Their agility and stealth are legendary, as is their ability to get to<br>
hard to reach places. They move faster than most species, but don’t run<br>
as fast as Spriggans. Felids advance in levels very slowly. They are<br>
skilled with many forms of magic, though less so with raw elemental<br>
magic.</p>
<p>Felids gain extra lives as they increase in levels. Upon death, they will<br>
be resurrected in a safe place, losing an experience level in the<br>
process.</p>
<p>Barachim (Ba)<br>
Barachim are an amphibious humanoid species, spawned at the dawn of time<br>
as servants for the gods. Inevitably, they rebelled and fled into the<br>
mortal world; but even uncounted years later, the darkness still flees at<br>
their approach, remembering those who they once served.</p>
<p>Barachim’s most remarkable trait is their grossly overmuscled legs, which<br>
allow them to leap great distances. When not leaping, they are somewhat<br>
slow-moving, and the long sight-lines that their heritage creates can be<br>
a major disadvantage, but they can master almost any skill.</p>
<p>Mummies (Mu)<br>
These are undead creatures who travel into the depths in search of<br>
revenge, redemption, or just because they want to.</p>
<p>Mummies progress slowly in levels, half again as slowly as Humans in all<br>
skills except fighting, spellcasting and necromancy. As they increase in<br>
levels, they become increasingly in touch with the powers of death, but<br>
cannot use some types of necromancy which only affect living creatures.<br>
The side effects of necromantic magic tend to be relatively harmless to<br>
Mummies. However, their desiccated bodies are highly flammable. They also<br>
cannot drink.</p>
<p>Like other undead, mummies are naturally immune to poisons, negative<br>
energy and torment; have little warmth left to be affected by cold; and<br>
are not susceptible to mutations.</p>
<h1 id="draconian-types">Draconian types</h1>
<p>Red Draconians<br>
feel at home in fiery surroundings. They are bad with ice magic but very<br>
proficient with fire. Their scorchingly hot breath will leave a lingering<br>
cloud of flame.</p>
<p>White Draconians<br>
stem from frost-bitten lands, and are naturally resistant to frost. Their<br>
breath is piercing cold. They are versed in ice magic, but bad at fire.</p>
<p>Green Draconians<br>
are used to venomous surroundings and breathe clouds of mephitic vapours.<br>
They are especially good in the arts of poison and without deficiencies<br>
in other magic realms. Later on, they will develop a poisonous stinger.</p>
<p>Yellow Draconians<br>
have a sulphurous breath full of corrosive acid, and later gain an acidic<br>
bite attack. They are acid resistant, too.</p>
<p>Grey Draconians<br>
have no breath weapon, but their bodies are adapted to the water,<br>
allowing them to swim. They are proficient with earth magic but bad with<br>
air magic, and they also have harder scales than other Draconians.</p>
<p>Black Draconians<br>
can unleash huge electrical discharges, and are naturally insulated. They<br>
are good at air magic but feel cumbersome with earth magic. Their wings<br>
will eventually grow larger, which allows them to fly when combined with<br>
their natural skill with air magic.</p>
<p>Purple Draconians<br>
are highly adapted to all spellcasting in general, and to hexes in<br>
particular. They are a bit better at evoking things than most other<br>
Draconians. They can breathe dispelling energy which strips those it hits<br>
of their enchantments, and are naturally stronger-willed than other<br>
draconians.</p>
<p>Pale Draconians<br>
are better at air and fire magic, and have no deficiencies in other<br>
schools. They breathe steam and, like their Purple cousins, have a slight<br>
advantage at Evocations.</p>

</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>In your quest, you play as one of a large number of different types of<br>
characters. Although each has its own strengths and weaknesses, some are<br>
definitely easier than others, at least to begin with. The best backgrounds<br>
for a beginner are probably Gladiators and Berserkers; if you really want<br>
to play a magician, try a Conjurer or a Hedge Wizard. However, not all<br>
species are equally well suited for all backgrounds. After you have<br>
selected a species, the background selection menu will show backgrounds<br>
generally considered to be more accessible for a species in a brighter<br>
colour.</p>
<p>Each background starts out with a different set of skills and items, but<br>
from there you can shape them as you will. Note that due to peculiarities<br>
of size or body shape, some species-background combinations start with a<br>
different inventory than described here.</p>
<h1 id="warrior-backgrounds">Warrior backgrounds</h1>
<p>Warriors are experienced at using physical weapons and defending<br>
themselves.</p>
<p>Fighters<br>
Fighters usually start with a good weapon of their choice, a suit of<br>
medium armour, a shield, and a potion of might.</p>
<p>Gladiators<br>
The Gladiator has been trained to fight in the ring. They start with a<br>
good weapon of their choice, light armour, headgear and some throwing<br>
weapons and nets.</p>
<p>Monks<br>
Monks have a head start with the divine. They start with only a simple<br>
weapon of their choice, a potion of divine ambrosia, and a robe, but when<br>
they choose a god for the first time, their spiritual training gives them<br>
a piety boost.</p>
<p>Hunters<br>
The Hunter is a type of fighter who specialises in missile weapons. A<br>
Hunter starts with a ranged weapon of their choice, a scroll of<br>
immolation, and a set of leathers.</p>
<p>Brigands<br>
A Brigand is a shady character who is especially good at killing, using<br>
daggers or darts. They start with a dagger, a robe and cloak, poisoned<br>
darts, and a few deadly and rare curare darts.</p>
<h1 id="adventurer-backgrounds">Adventurer backgrounds</h1>
<p>Adventurers have varied and idiosyncratic skills that they have picked up<br>
in their travels.</p>
<p>Artificers<br>
Artificers have built, bought or burgled an assortment of magic wands to<br>
help them through the early Dungeon. Wands have a limited number of uses,<br>
though, so they’ll want to upgrade from their short sword ASAP.</p>
<p>Wanderers<br>
Wanderers are “jacks-of-all-trades, masters of none”. They start the game<br>
with a random assortment of skills, items, and maybe spells.</p>
<p>Delvers<br>
Delvers have, through some mishap, found themselves several floors below<br>
the surface of the Dungeon. They’re equipped with a wide variety of<br>
magical escape tools, and are well advised to use them to travel to<br>
earlier dungeon floors as quickly as possible.</p>
<h1 id="zealot-backgrounds">Zealot backgrounds</h1>
<p>Zealots start the game already worshipping a god.</p>
<p>Berserkers<br>
Berserkers are hardy warriors who worship Trog the Wrathful, from whom<br>
they get the power to go berserk (as well as a number of other powers,<br>
should they prove worthy), but who forbids the use of spell magic. They<br>
enter the Dungeon with a weapon of their choice, and dressed in animal<br>
skins.</p>
<p>Abyssal Knights<br>
The Abyssal Knight is a fighter serving Lugonu the Unformed, ruler of the<br>
Abyss. They are granted some power over the Abyss, and must spread death<br>
and disorder in return. They are sent from the Abyss into the Dungeon to<br>
spread corruption and chaos, starting with a simple weapon of their<br>
choice and leather armour.</p>
<p>Chaos Knights<br>
The Chaos Knight is a plaything of Xom, subject to the god’s constantly<br>
changing moods. Xom is a very unpredictable (and possibly psychotic)<br>
entity who rewards or punishes according to whim. They begin with a<br>
lightly enchanted leather armour, a simple weapon of their choice, and<br>
one of Xom’s toys.</p>
<p>Cinder Acolytes<br>
Cinder Acolytes serve Ignis, the Dying Flame, who grants them incredible<br>
power over fire… but there is only so much fire left to draw on, and<br>
once it burns out, acolytes may need to abandon Ignis. They start with a<br>
robe, a choice of flaming weapons, and the spell Scorch.</p>
<h1 id="warrior-mage-backgrounds">Warrior-mage backgrounds</h1>
<p>Warrior mages begin the game with a mix of physical combat and magic<br>
skills, though usually excel at neither. They start with a library of<br>
spells and (usually) some way of defending themselves.</p>
<p>Transmuters<br>
Transmuters specialise in transmutation magic, and can cause strange<br>
changes in themselves and others. They deal damage primarily in unarmed<br>
combat, often using transformations to enhance their defensive and<br>
offensive capabilities. They also enter the dungeon with a potion of<br>
lignification.</p>
<p>Warpers<br>
Warpers specialise in translocation magic, and are experts in travelling<br>
long distances and positioning themselves precisely and use this to their<br>
advantage in melee or missile combat. They start with a scroll of<br>
blinking, a selection of translocation spells, some dispersal boomerangs,<br>
a simple weapon of their choice, and leather armour.</p>
<p>Arcane Marksmen<br>
Arcane Marksmen are Hunters who use debilitating spells to assist their<br>
ranged attacks. They are particularly good at keeping their enemies at a<br>
distance. They begin the game with a ranged weapon of their choice, some<br>
spells to support its use, a scroll of vulnerability to help those<br>
spells, and a robe.</p>
<p>Enchanters<br>
The Enchanter specialises in the subtle art of hexes. Instead of directly<br>
damaging foes, hexes disable and debilitate them, allowing the Enchanter<br>
to finish the helpless creatures in combat. The Enchanter begins with a<br>
lightly enchanted dagger, a robe, potions of invisibility, and a<br>
selection of hexes.</p>
<h1 id="mage-backgrounds">Mage backgrounds</h1>
<p>A mage is not an available character background by itself, but a type of<br>
background, encompassing Hedge Wizards, Conjurers, Summoners, Necromancers,<br>
various Elementalists and Venom Mages. Mages are the best at using magic.<br>
Among other things, they start with a robe, a potion of magic, and spells<br>
which should see them through the first several levels of the Dungeon.</p>
<p>Hedge Wizards<br>
A Hedge Wizard is a magician who does not specialise in any area of<br>
magic. Hedge Wizards start with a variety of magical skills and with<br>
Magic Dart memorised, from a large library of varied low-level spells.<br>
They also get a wizard hat.</p>
<p>Conjurers<br>
The Conjurer specialises in the violent and destructive magic of<br>
conjuration spells. Like Wizards, the Conjurer starts with the Magic Dart<br>
spell, in their case from a library of destructive conjurations.</p>
<p>Summoners<br>
The Summoner specialises in calling creatures from this and other worlds<br>
to give assistance. Although they can at first summon only very wimpy<br>
creatures, the more advanced summoning spells allow summoners to call on<br>
such powers as elementals and demons.</p>
<p>Necromancers<br>
The Necromancer is a magician who specialises in the less pleasant side<br>
of magic. Necromantic spells are a varied bunch, but many involve some<br>
degree of risk or harm to the caster.</p>
<p>Elementalists<br>
Elementalists are magicians who specialise in one of the four types of<br>
elemental magic: air, fire, earth or ice.</p>
<p>Fire Magic<br>
tends towards indiscriminate, wide-range destructive conjurations and<br>
starting fires.</p>
<p>Ice Magic<br>
offers diffuse, subtle effects, both defensive and offensive.</p>
<p>Air Magic<br>
provides powerful but difficult to direct spells.</p>
<p>Earth Magic<br>
is a versatile school, with destructive, debilitating and utility<br>
spells available. Earth Elementalists start with the Sandblast spell,<br>
and some stones to use with it.</p>
<p>Venom Mages<br>
Venom Mages specialise in poison magic, which is extremely useful in the<br>
shallower levels of the Dungeon where few creatures are immune to it.</p>

<h1 id="fighting-skills">Fighting skills</h1>
<p>Fighting is the basic skill used in ranged and melee combat, and applies no<br>
matter which weapon your character is wielding (if any). Fighting is also<br>
the skill that determines the number of hit points your character gets as<br>
they increase in levels (note that this is calculated so that you don’t get<br>
a long run advantage by starting out with a high Fighting skill). Unlike<br>
the specific weapon skill, Fighting does not change the speed with which<br>
you make your attacks.</p>
<p>Weapon skills affect your ability to fight with specific melee weapons.<br>
Weapon skills include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Short Blades</li>
<li>Long Blades</li>
<li>Maces &amp; Flails</li>
<li>Axes</li>
<li>Staves</li>
<li>Polearms</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are already good using a class of weapons, say Long Blades, you’ll<br>
get a bonus to using similar weapons, like Short Blades; this is called<br>
crosstraining and is shown in blue in the skill menu. Similar types of<br>
weapons are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Short Blades and Long Blades</li>
<li>Maces &amp; Flails and Axes</li>
<li>Polearms and Axes</li>
<li>Staves and Polearms</li>
<li>Staves and Maces &amp; Flails</li>
</ul>
<p>Being good at a specific weapon improves the speed with which you attack<br>
with it. Both the base speed and the best (lowest) possible speed are<br>
displayed in the inventory entry for a weapon. Although lighter weapons are<br>
easier to use initially, as they strike quickly and accurately, heavier<br>
weapons increase in damage potential very quickly as you improve your skill<br>
with them. You can check the current delay of your weapon by swinging it at<br>
air (using ctrl-direction) and looking at the number in parentheses next to<br>
your turncount.</p>
<p>Some weapon types have special abilities. Axes are able to cleave through<br>
multiple enemies in a single swing, hitting enemies in an arc around the<br>
wielder with every attack. Polearms can reach farther and allow the wielder<br>
to attack an opponent two squares away, and even reach over monsters. Use<br>
the ‘v’ command to target a specific monster with a reaching attack, or use<br>
Autofight (‘tab’) to reach automatically.</p>
<p>Unarmed Combat is a special fighting skill. It allows your character to<br>
make a powerful attack when unarmed and also to punch with the off hand as<br>
an additional melee attack. The Unarmed Combat skill continues to increase<br>
your attack speed while unarmed until it can be raised no more.</p>
<p>Note that auxiliary attacks (such as a Palentonga’s tail-slap or a<br>
Minotaur’s headbutt) are not affected by the Unarmed Combat skill.</p>
<h1 id="ranged-combat-skills">Ranged combat skills</h1>
<p>There are a number of individual weapon skills for missile weapons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Throwing</li>
<li>Bows</li>
<li>Crossbows</li>
<li>Slings</li>
</ul>
<p>Throwing is the skill for all things hurled without a launcher: boomerangs,<br>
javelins, nets, darts, etc. The other skills refer to various types of<br>
ranged weapons.</p>
<p>Just as with melee weapons, ranged weapon skills and throwing skills<br>
increase the speed at which you attack, along with slightly increasing your<br>
accuracy and damage. Missile weapons, unlike melee or throwing weapons, are<br>
slowed by wearing heavy armour. Increasing your Strength and Armour skill<br>
will partially mitigate this.</p>
<p>Since the motion of using a sling and throwing a stone are somewhat<br>
similar, these skills crosstrain:</p>
<ul>
<li>Throwing and Slings</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="magic-skills">Magic skills</h1>
<p>Spellcasting is the basic skill for magic use. It affects your reserves of<br>
magical energy (Magic) in the same way that Fighting affects your hit<br>
points: every time you increase the Spellcasting skill you gain some magic<br>
points, and you gain a spell level every time you reach a skill level<br>
divisible by 0.5. Spellcasting also helps with the power and success rate<br>
of your spells, but to a lesser extent than the more specialised magical<br>
skills.</p>
<p>There are also individual skills for each different type of magic; the<br>
higher the skill, the more powerful the spell. Multidisciplinary spells use<br>
an average of the two or three skills.</p>
<h1 id="miscellaneous-skills">Miscellaneous skills</h1>
<p>Armour<br>
Having a high Armour skill means that you are skilled at wearing armour<br>
of all kinds, multiplying the protection provided not just by body armour<br>
but also by cloaks, gloves, etc. It also very slightly mitigates the<br>
penalties to spellcasting and missile weapon speed from wearing heavy<br>
armour.</p>
<p>Dodging<br>
A high Dodging skill helps you to evade melee and ranged attacks more<br>
effectively. This is more easily done in light armour, but can still be<br>
useful in heavier armour.</p>
<p>Stealth<br>
Helps you avoid being noticed, and makes monsters more likely to lose<br>
track of you when you leave their line of sight. Wearing heavy armour<br>
penalises stealth attempts. Large creatures (like Trolls) are bad at<br>
stealth, except for Nagas, which are unusually stealthy.</p>
<p>Stealth also helps you make a very powerful first strike against a<br>
sleeping/resting monster who hasn’t noticed you yet. This is most<br>
effective with a dagger, slightly less effective with other short blades<br>
and Felid claws, and less useful (although still by no means negligible)<br>
with any other weapon.</p>
<p>Stealth also improves some melee attacks against confused, distracted, or<br>
otherwise incapacitated monsters, though this is much less effective than<br>
when the monster is asleep or paralysed.</p>
<p>Note that in addition to the bonus from weapon type, there is an<br>
additional stabbing bonus based on the average of your stealth skill and<br>
your skill with your wielded weapon.</p>
<p>Shields<br>
Affects the amount of protection you gain by using a shield, and the<br>
degree to which it hinders your evasion, attack speed and spellcasting<br>
success. Mastering the Shields skill removes all penalties from using a<br>
shield.</p>
<p>Invocations<br>
Affects your ability to call on your god for aid. Those skilled at<br>
Invocations have reduced failure rates and produce more powerful effects.<br>
Some gods (such as Trog) do not require followers to learn this skill, or<br>
use a different skill for their abilities instead (such as Necromancy<br>
under Kikubaaqudgha).</p>
<p>Invocations can increase your maximum magical reserves, although it has a<br>
smaller effect than Spellcasting in this regard. The bonuses are not<br>
cumulative: the highest contribution from Spellcasting or Invocations is<br>
used.</p>
<p>Evocations<br>
This skill lets you use wands much more effectively, in terms of both<br>
damage and precision. Similarly, various other items that have evocable<br>
powers work better for characters trained in this skill.</p>

<pre><code>                   LIST OF KEYS AND COMMANDS
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h1 id="main-screen">Main screen</h1>
<p>Crawl has many commands to be issued by single key strokes. This can become<br>
confusing, since there are also several modes; here is the full list. Some<br>
commands are particularly useful in combination with certain interface<br>
options; such options are mentioned in the list. For a description of them,<br>
please look into options_guide.txt. For a more terse list of all commands,<br>
use ‘??’ in-game. Most modes (targeting, level map, interlevel travel) also<br>
have help menus via ‘?’ on their own.</p>
<h2 id="movement-1">Movement</h2>
<p>direction<br>
This moves one square. The direction is either one of the numpad cursor<br>
keys (try both Numlock on and off) or one of the Rogue vi keys<br>
(hjklyubn).</p>
<p>Shift-direction or / direction<br>
This moves straight until something interesting is found (like a<br>
monster). If the first square is a trap, movement starts nonetheless.</p>
<p>o<br>
Auto-explore. Setting the option explore_greedy to true makes<br>
auto-explore run to interesting items (those that get picked up<br>
automatically) or piles (checking the contents). Autoexploration will<br>
open doors on its own unless you set travel_open_doors to avoid or<br>
approach.</p>
<p>G or Ctrl-G<br>
Interlevel travel (to arbitrary dungeon levels or waypoints). Remembers<br>
old destinations if interrupted. This command has its own set of<br>
shortcuts; use ? for help on them.</p>
<p>Ctrl-W<br>
Set waypoint (a digit between 0 and 9). Go to a waypoint by pressing<br>
Ctrl-G or uppercase G, then the waypoint’s digit.</p>
<h2 id="attacking-and-firing">Attacking and firing</h2>
<p>Several of these commands enter targeting mode; see “Targeting” for more<br>
information about this mode.</p>
<p>direction<br>
If a monster is in the target square, attack that monster.</p>
<p>Tab<br>
Autofight: Attack the nearest monster with your current weapon. If the<br>
nearest monster is not in range, by default, this will move towards it.</p>
<p>v<br>
Targeted attacks with your primary weapon, including attacking<br>
non-adjacent monsters with a polearm, or firing a wielded launcher<br>
(regardless of the state of the main quiver).</p>
<p>Q<br>
Quiver an item, spell, or ability from a menu.</p>
<p>( and )<br>
Cycle quiver to next/previous suitable action (item, spell, ability).</p>
<p>f<br>
Fire currently quivered action, showing a targeter. If some monster is in<br>
sight and the action takes a target, either the last target or the<br>
nearest monster will be automatically highlighted. If the action does not<br>
take a target, the display will typically show an area of effect.<br>
Pressing f again triggers the action.</p>
<p>Shift-tab, p<br>
Autofire: Fire a quivered action, if needed selecting a target<br>
automatically; typically fires at the nearest monster.</p>
<p>F<br>
Directly choose ammo to throw or fire. In contrast to ‘f’ this does not<br>
interact with the quiver.</p>
<p>V<br>
Evoke an item directly from the inventory. This includes using wands.</p>
<h2 id="spells-and-abilities">Spells and abilities</h2>
<p>Spells and abilities may also be quivered; see “Attacking and firing”. Many<br>
spells and abilities enter targeting mode on activation; see “Targeting”<br>
for more information about this mode.</p>
<p>a<br>
Show the ability menu, allowing you to activate an ability or read its<br>
description.</p>
<p>z<br>
Cast a spell. Should the spell demand monsters as targets but there are<br>
none within range, casting will be stopped. In this case, neither turns<br>
nor magic are used. If you want to cast the spell nonetheless, use Z.</p>
<p>Z<br>
Cast a spell regardless of available targets.</p>
<h2 id="resting-1">Resting</h2>
<p>s, Del, . or Numpad 5<br>
Rests for one turn. This is most often used tactically for waiting a few<br>
turns. Serious resting should be done with the 5 command, for the sake of<br>
your keyboard and sanity.</p>
<p>5 or Shift-Numpad 5<br>
Long resting, until both health and magic points are full.</p>
<p>Resting is the only way to get rid of manticore spikes, but is otherwise<br>
indistinguishable from any other action; healing, magic point restoration,<br>
etc, proceed at the same rate, whether you’re resting or not.</p>
<h2 id="dungeon-interaction">Dungeon interaction</h2>
<p>O<br>
Open door. This is also done automatically by walking into the door.</p>
<p>C<br>
Close door.</p>
<p>Ctrl-direction or * direction<br>

Use staircase to go higher, or use a shop, altar, or portal.</p>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<p>Use staircase to go deeper, or use a shop, altar, or portal.</p>
<p>;<br>
Examine occupied tile and auto-pickup eligible items. Can also be used to<br>
pick up only part of a stack with no other item on the same square.<br>
When a monster is present the first press of ; will only examine the tile<br>
and a second press of ; will pick up all auto-pickup eligible items.</p>
<p>x<br>
Examine surroundings, see below. Has ‘?’ help.</p>
<p>X<br>
Examine level map, see below. Has ‘?’ help.</p>
<p>Ctrl-X<br>

descriptions and travel to an item or feature.</p>
<p>Ctrl-O<br>
Show dungeon overview (branches, shops, etc.).</p>
<p>!<br>
Annotate a level. You can annotate any level of a branch of which you<br>
have found the entrance. You can enter any text. This annotation is then<br>
listed in the dungeon overview (Ctrl-O) and also shown whenever you enter<br>
that level again. Should your annotation contain an exclamation mark (!),<br>
you will be prompted before entering the level. An empty string clears<br>
annotations.</p>

Find. This searches in stashes and shops, you can use regular expressions<br>
and also terms like ‘long blades’, ‘shop’, ‘altar’, ‘artefact’. If you<br>
are looking for altars to a special god, a search for ‘Trog’ , etc.<br>
works. A string like ‘D:13’ will list all known items on that level.<br>
‘D:1}’ will search for items on level 1 only, as opposed to ‘D:1’, which<br>
will also list items on D:10 through D:15. Once the list of all found<br>
places is displayed, you can cause auto-travel to go there (press the<br>
associated letter) or you can examine the items (press ? followed by the<br>

</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>You can use the { command to manually inscribe items; alternatively, you<br>
can also inscribe when viewing items from the inventory (done by pressing<br>
the item’s letter). This adds a note in curly braces to the item<br>
description. Besides simply allowing you to make comments about items,<br>
there are several further uses.</p>
<h1 id="inscriptions-as-shortcuts">Inscriptions as shortcuts</h1>
<p>You can use inscriptions to define shortcuts for easy access to items,<br>
regardless of their actual inventory letter. For example, if an item’s<br>
inscription contains “@w9”, you can type ‘w9’ in order to wield it. Instead<br>
of the 9, any other digit works as well. And instead of 'w’ield, any other<br>
command used for handling items can be used: 'r’ead, 'q’uaff, e’v’oke,<br>
'f’ire, etc. Using “@*9” will make any action command followed by ‘9’ use<br>
this item.</p>
<h1 id="safety-inscriptions">Safety inscriptions</h1>
<p>Inscriptions containing the following strings affect the behaviour of some<br>
commands:</p>
<p>!*<br>
Prompt before any action using this item.</p>
<p>!w<br>
Prompt before wielding and unwielding this item.</p>
<p>!a<br>
Prompt before attacking when wielding this item. Non-weapons and ranged<br>
weapons prompt automatically. Also, if you answer ‘y’, you won’t be<br>
prompted again until you switch weapons. To reset this prompt while<br>
keeping the current weapon wielded, use ‘w’ and select the current<br>
weapon.</p>
<p>!d<br>
Prompt before dropping this item.</p>
<p>!q<br>
Prompt before quaffing this item.</p>
<p>!r<br>

<p>You can use the autoinscribe option to have some items automatically<br>
inscribed. See options_guide.txt for details. Some examples are:</p>
<p>autoinscribe = stone:=f<br>
autoinscribe = wand of heal wounds:!v</p>
<h1 id="artefact-autoinscriptions">Artefact autoinscriptions</h1>
<p>Artefacts are automatically inscribed with abbreviated descriptions of<br>
their properties. The inscriptions use the following general ideas:</p>
<p>rXXX<br>
signifies a resistance; e.g. rF+ (a level of fire resistance), rN+++<br>
(three levels of negative energy resistance), rC- (cold vulnerability).</p>
<p>+XXX<br>
signifies an ability you can evoke via the ‘a’ command. E.g. +Inv<br>
(evocable, temporary invisibility).</p>
<p>-XXX<br>
signifies a suppressed ability. E.g. -Cast (spellcasting forbidden).</p>
<p>XX+6<br>
means a boost to some numerical stat (similar with XX-2, etc.). E.g.<br>
Slay+3 (+3 to accuracy and damage of melee and ranged combat).</p>
<p>For more information, examine an item (by selecting it in your<br>
(i)nventory); each property of an artefact will be listed and described.</p>

<hr>
<p>Dungeon sprints are short, faster-paced variants of Crawl that aim at more<br>
of a “coffee break” style of gameplay. They can be accessed from the main<br>
menu, and save files coexist with regular game saves. Sprint modes all use<br>
the basic Crawl mechanics, but with certain aspects of the game sped up.<br>
All sprint games take place on a single map. The most noticeable speed<br>
change is much more rapid experience gain, as well as piety growth. Many<br>
sprint modes focus on some specific aspect of the game, and several<br>
introduce variant mechanics or items unique to that mode. In all of the<br>
sprint maps, you win by finding and escaping with the Orb of Zot, but the<br>
conditions for finding the Orb vary.</p>
<p>Sprint I: “Red Sonja”<br>
Red Sonja, originally called “dungeon sprint 1”, is the original dungeon<br>
sprint map, putting the quest for the Orb of Zot into a single level.</p>
<p>Sprint II: “The Violet Keep of Menkaure”<br>
Menkaure has stolen the Orb of Zot and hidden it away in his keep; can<br>
you find it?</p>
<p>Sprint III: “The Ten Rune Challenge”<br>
Originally introduced in the 2010 tournament, this sprint map places 10<br>
runes and the Orb of Zot in a single dungeon level.</p>
<p>Sprint IV: “Fedhas’ Mad Dash”<br>
Fedhas’ Mad Dash is a shorter sprint map, a contest organised by Fedhas<br>
Madash. The monsters are Fedhas-themed; watch out for the many flavours<br>
of Oklobs! As usual, your goal is to find the Orb of Zot and then escape.</p>
<p>Sprint V: “Ziggurat Sprint”<br>
Ziggurat Sprint focuses on the Ziggurat mechanic. The map consists of a<br>
sequence of open-layout rooms of increasing size and difficulty, each<br>
with many monsters around some theme; rooms are connected by<br>
transporters. The starting room provides powerful equipment for getting<br>
started, as well as altars. If you can make it through all rooms, you<br>
will be taken to a room with the Orb and some exit stairs.</p>
<p>Sprint VI: “Thunderdome”<br>
In the Thunderdome you face a large set of monsters, including many<br>
uniques, in a cross-shaped arena. Monsters appear in rounds, with boss<br>
rounds every 5 rounds (every 3 after round 27), and the final boss at<br>
round 27. If you kill every monster in a normal or boss round, you will<br>
get some gold, arena points, and a bit of time to rest. In a lightning<br>
round, to win you just need to survive. A variety of interesting items<br>
are available for purchase in shops along the sides – don’t miss the<br>
QUAD DAMAGE! To win this sprint, kill the final boss, and the Orb will<br>
appear.</p>
<p>Sprint VII: “The Pits”<br>
This map is a “traditional-style” sprint map that embeds the quest for<br>
the Orb of Zot into a dungeon level with three runes.</p>
<p>Sprint VIII: “Arena of Blood”<br>
In the Arena of Blood, also known as “meatsprint”, you are a vessel of<br>
Makhleb, wielding Makhleb’s immensely destructive Axe of Woe against a<br>
large variety of meat-based monsters in an open arena. To win this mode,<br>
kill the Meatlord, pick up the Orb of Zot, and escape.</p>
<p>Sprint IX: “|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||”<br>
This mode, also known as “linesprint”, puts the entire game of Crawl in a<br>
single winding 1-space corridor, with each region as one straight line.<br>
Fight your way to the middle of the map to claim the Orb of Zot. Escape<br>
with it, or continue onwards to collect all runes first.</p>
