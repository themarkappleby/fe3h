			<strong>Top&nbsp;</strong><strong>Tier</strong>&nbsp;- These are classes that you almost certainly want to master when you have them available, and should strongly consider diverting slightly to unlock and master. They give extremely powerful, versatile bonuses for mastery.

					<span style="color:#444444;"><strong>Brigand - Death Blow</strong>&nbsp;(Intermediate)</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					I think most people are aware of how good Death Blow and Fiendish Blow are. As an Intermediate class, Brigand can be accessed fairly early in the game, and does not need a massive investment into axes to learn either. In exchange, you get probably the best player phase skill in the game, dealing 6 extra damage when attacking, 12 if doubling, and potentially as much as 24 extra with brave weapons. A truly impressive game changer.
				</p>

				<p>
					&nbsp;
				</p>

				<p>
					<span style="color:#444444;"><strong>Mage - Fiendish Blow</strong> (Intermediate)</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					Pretty much exactly the same as the above, but for magic users. There are very few magic users who won't be able to access Mage easily, and again it's incredibly valuable on the offence. While some physical units probably want to go through other classes than Brigand, I don't think a single magic user wants to skip mage unless they're going to be almost exclusively support units.
				</p>

				<p>
					&nbsp;
				</p>

				<p>
					<span style="color:#996600;"><strong>Monk - Draw Back, Magic +2</strong> (Beginner)</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					The beginner classes offer bonuses that aren't obviously powerful, but are actually really strong. And of those, Monk and Soldier are most valuable. Monk's Draw Back has a plethora of uses. This&nbsp;can include simple things like letting you move an extra tile by drawing back at the end of your movement, a pretty valuable trick considering even advanced magic classes have only 4 movement, making them quickly fall behind if you aren't careful. Mounted mages can use it mid turn to get one extra turn of movement, and give someone else an extra point of move as well of course, at the cost of another action. And of course it can be used to drag people out of danger, or move them away from being adjacent to enemies so you can attack with someone else, and so on. It has a lot of uses. Also, since magic users mostly don't need offensive combat arts, the art doesn't really have much other opportunity cost, which is nice.
				</p>

				<p>
					On top of Draw back, you get Magic +2. Not as exciting, and certainly no Fiendish Blow, but still surprisingly solid. I've had mages still using it right up to endgame, partially because of a lack of other better options, but in general it's more valuable than you first think. It's maybe not as good as the other beginner stat +2 skills because Mages won't be doing as much on enemy phase, so it often ends up being a partial Fiendish Blow that also boosts healing/white magic range, but it's still okay.
				</p>

				<p>
					&nbsp;
				</p>

				<p>
					<span style="color:#444444;"><strong>Pegasus Knight - Darting Blow, Triangle Attack</strong>&nbsp;(Intermediate)</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					Compared to Death Blow and Fiendish Blow, Darting Blow is a little less useful I feel overall, and that's for two reasons: Firstly, there are significantly fewer units who can even access it due to being female only, but more significantly, +6 speed doesn't help you kill enemies in one attack, while Death/Fiendish Blow do. This also means you don't really get much benefit from the skill while using arts - including the Triangle Attack skill the class comes with. Still, it's an effective skill overall, and available early in the game. It does help secure a number of doubles and can be indirectly converted into extra power by letting you wield heavier weapons at times, while still doubling.
				</p>

				<p>
					Triangle Attack is not a major factor in this placement overall. It's more of a small niche bonus than a significant tool. It's a strong art in theory, but it's difficult to set up for and use consistently, and it's way worse than triangle attacks from previous games.
				</p>

				<p>
					&nbsp;
				</p>

				<p>
					<span style="color:#996600;"><strong>Soldier - Reposition, Defence +2</strong> (Beginner)</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					Everything I've said about Draw Back above? Pretty much all applies to Reposition,&nbsp;<em>except better</em>. Reposition can let you move someone else 2 extra spaces, which is hugely valuable when it comes to getting people to key locations quickly. It's almost like a mini dancer that can still be on a mounted class in some cases. I've had several cases where I've cut turns off of chapters or dealt with annoying threats by repositioning several times so I can get a boss kill, or moved someone else to reach a dangerous enemy with enough move left over to canto out of range (or at least canto back enough to be repositioned back out of range). Perhaps my favourite use of it is to reposition people across terrain they can't cross - walls, gaps, pillars etc. can all be repositioned over by fliers.
				</p>

				<p>
					Defence +2 is also nice I guess. Like with Magic +2 it's decent for a lot of game, but unlike Magic +2 it doesn't really get outclassed by an Intermediate skill. Any defensive unit benefits from it, really.
				</p>

		<p>
			&nbsp;
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>High Tier</strong>&nbsp;- These classes give strong bonuses, if you were planning to use the class anyway it is probably worth mastering for these bonuses. They may not be as worthwhile to go out of your way to master however, unless the mastery skill has a particular synergy with something or fills a niche your team needs.
		</p>

					&nbsp;
				</p>

				<p>
					<span style="color:#3498db;"><strong>Dancer - Special Dance</strong>&nbsp;(Unique)</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					+4 Speed from dancing is great. +4 Dex/Luk are nice as well I suppose. Really, there's little reason to not use this once you have it, but it's of course limited to one class so there isn't much to say.
				</p>

				<p>
					&nbsp;
				</p>

				<p>
					<span style="color:#996600;"><strong>Fighter - Shove, Strength +2</strong> (Beginner)</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					You've seen what's been said about the movement skills above, and if you've played FE9 or FE10 you know how useful shoving people around can be in general. It's not quite as good as the above skills though, mostly because it only provides 1 movement rather than 2, and also it's generally less convenient to be behind people to move them forward than in front of them I find.
				</p>

				<p>
					Strength +2 is also decent, basically see what was said about Magic +2, but it is probably more useful than Magic +2, because physical units see more enemy phase, so it's a bit less outclassed by Death Blow, if that makes sense. Even if you don't use it forever it's pretty solid for the first 50% of the game or more.
				</p>

				<p>
					&nbsp;
				</p>

				<p>
					<span style="color:#996600;"><strong>Myrmidon - Swap, Speed +2</strong> (Beginner)</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					Last and most definitely least, Swap. It's way less good than all the other movement skills because you can't use it to move forwards efficiently. I would say Myrmidon would be Upper Mid tier actually based solely on Swap, but on the other extreme, Speed +2 is by far the best of the Beginner class stat boosters. Extra speed benefits basically everyone, securing extra doubles, or perhaps being able to let you use a heavier weapon without losing the double.
				</p>

				<p>
					&nbsp;
				</p>

				<p>
					<span style="color:#9b59b6;"><strong>War Master - Quick Riposte, War Master's Strike</strong>&nbsp;(Master)</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					Quick Riposte is one of the best skills in the game, hands down. Quick Riposte not only gives you a guaranteed double attack, but also&nbsp;<em>cancels the opponents double attack</em>&nbsp;- as you may recall if you've fought the Lord of the Lake in Leonie/Lynhardt's paralogue. This basically means you can just pretty much ignore speed on such a character on enemy phase, which is pretty insane. War Master's Strike is also very solid, though (as the name suggests) you do need to stay as a War Master to utilise it. This art deals effective damage to all foes, basically doubling your weapon's might, on top of a hefty +30 hit rate bonus and +3 might extra. It's not the best thing ever, but with a high power axe this can let you get a lot of kills.
				</p>

				<p>
					In Maddening, it's generally easier to master classes earlier in the game - and as a result, War Master has risen from Upper Mid to High tier. You still won't get QR until late in the game, but it'll probably be a solid 1-2 chapters earlier than on Hard, which is a fairly substantial chunk of time when we're talking going from e.g. 1-3 chapters left, up to 3-5 chapters left.

		<p>
			&nbsp;
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Upper Mid Tier</strong>&nbsp;- These classes give good bonuses for mastery but has flaws or issues - this could be that the skill does not have a huge amount of time to be valuable, or perhaps it's somewhat niche. These classes are often worth mastering when in them, but not always.
		</p>

				</p>

				<p>
					<span style="color:#444444;"><strong>Archer - Hit +20</strong>&nbsp;(Intermediate)</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					Extra Hit is good, although not amazing. It's nice to get on Archers, since their hit rates do plummet as they attack from long distances, and attacking from long distances is often a good thing. It's not something most people would want to go out of their way to get, but it's something you probably want to make use of if you do get.
				</p>

				<p>
					&nbsp;
				</p>

				<p>
					<span style="color:#3498db;"><strong>Commoner/Noble - HP+5</strong>&nbsp;(Unique)</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					This is a pretty useful skill early in the game, and it's very low investment to get. Characters in your house will likely all pick this up before hitting level 5 on Maddening difficulty. While 5 HP&nbsp;does get outclassed more quickly than the +2 skills Beginner classes give, you'll probably have space for HP+5 on character builds for quite some time, until better skills become available, so the low investment combined with decent value make it a fairly solid skill overall.
				</p>

				<p>
					&nbsp;
				</p>

				<p>
					<span style="color:#3498db;"><strong>Enlightened One - Sacred Power</strong>&nbsp;(Unique)</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					It's a solid aura bonus, basically combining Charm and Lily's Poise. It synergises with Byleth's Professor's Guidance in a way, since they already want to be adjacent to people who are fighting. Basically a nice skill to get that provides extra support for teammates and another way to boost other people's damage.
				</p>

				<p>
					&nbsp;
				</p>

				<p>
					<span style="color:#444444;"><strong>Mercenary - Vantage&nbsp;</strong>(Intermediate)</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					If you can kill someone on the first attack, Vantage is great. If not, it's worthless. In most cases, you can't kill on the first attack. Vantage is best when it has synergies with ways to kill quickly - high damage, critical rate etc. Or things like Wrath, Defiant Crit etc. - but we'll talk about those a little later. It's decent, but unfortunately the Mercenary (and swords in general) line leans towards higher speed, less towards high damage, which is not ideal for Vantage. As an aside, if Vantage and Desperation swapped places in where they were learned, I feel like both would be more valuable.
				</p>

				<p>
					&nbsp;
				</p>

				<p>
					<span style="color:#f1c40f;"><strong>Warrior - Wrath</strong>&nbsp;(Advanced)</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					Wrath is a pretty solid enemy phase skill, which sadly doesn't synergise with Quick Riposte above due to (almost) mutually exclusive activation conditions. Good luck staying at exactly 50% HP to make use of both if you're into that I guess. Wrath works best when combined with Vantage, but unfortunately the two classes have quite different progression routes. Not impossible but a little bit awkward. And as mentioned, one nice thing about using skills like this in 3H is that Divine Pulse exists, so they're less risky than in other FE games. You can set your character up with them, put them in enemy range and if you don't get the luck you were hoping for on enemy phase, divine pulse back and try something else. Can't do it TOO much, but it's a very solid safety net that turns "awesome but impractical" into "awesome and practical".
				</p>

				<p>
					&nbsp;
				</p>

				<p>
					<span style="color:#9b59b6;"><strong>Wyvern Lord - Defiant Crit</strong>&nbsp;(Master)</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					See Gremory for an overview of Defiant skills.
				</p>

				<p>
					Defiant Crit is basically worse Wrath but with potential to activate on player phase. Wrath is really good though, and you can use both at the same time for insane crit bonuses, effectively 100%. Probably best used with Wrath and Vantage together for (near) guaranteed crits before enemies can even hit you. Perhaps add Defiant Str if you can get it in time. It helps that this is a good class as well, but it's still tough to get until very late in the game. Even on its own, Defiant Crit can be a decent skill - any time you drop HP, you get a very respectable crit rate until you get healed up - though it does excel when combined with other skills. Add in that Wyvern Lord is, in general a very solid class, you'll often end up just picking this up on a few characters, and may have space for it without really needing to build into it.
				</p>

				<p>
					&nbsp;
				</p>

				<p>
					<span style="color:#f1c40f;"><strong>Wyvern Rider - Seal Defence</strong>&nbsp;(Advanced)</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					On Maddening, Seal skills became a whole lot more valuable - many enemies can be tough to OHKO, and Seal Defence makes it that much easier to secure a kill on the second attack. It really shines against giant beasts, who will often take a large group to take down. -5 Def on one of these quickly adds up, increasing the damage of many attacks and making it easier to deplete entire health bars in a single round of combat.

			<strong>Lower Mid Tier</strong>&nbsp; - These classes give fairly good bonuses for mastery but have bigger flaws or issues than those in Upper Mid. They are classes you may not feel like you need to master, or which give skills that are somewhat more niche or harder to access, but are often still at least decent.

				<p>
					<span style="color:#3498db;"><strong>Barbarossa - Wind God</strong>&nbsp;(Unique)</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					Wind God is a very good combat art by stats, a big damage boost, big hit boost and 2-5 range, covering one of Barbarossa's one weaknesses (no extra range). Of course it's unique to Claude, so it does have very limited accessibility, but Barbarossa is a great class for Claude, and while you'll probably master Barbarossa quite late in the game, it'll give enough time to take advantage of this powerful art.
				</p>

				<p>
					&nbsp;
				</p>

				<p>
					<span style="color:#f1c40f;"><strong>Bishop - Renewal</strong>&nbsp;(Advanced)</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					Healing isn't a massive issue in 3H, but with Renewal it's a bit less of an issue. Can be nice to have, but it's rarely something to go out of your way for.
				</p>

				<p>
					&nbsp;
				</p>

				<p>
					<span style="color:#9b59b6;"><strong>Bow Knight - Defiant Spd</strong>&nbsp;(Master)</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					See Gremory for an overview of Defiant skills
				</p>

				<p>
					Defiant Spd is probably most useful combined with Desperation + Defiant Str for player phase nuking. Unfortunately that's a pretty awkward progression line, but at least Cavalier and Bow Knight have overlap. Not an especially useful skill on enemy phase, since if you're below 25% HP you probably want to kill the enemy before they can attack, not after with a double. On Maddening, generally higher enemy speed makes Defiant Spd more useful overall - +8 speed doesn't just let you secure a few extra doubles but really lets you actually start doubling consistently. Being available on Bow Knight is also great, as they're an ideal class for staying out of danger, dealing consistent player phase damage. While I haven't personally tried it, I can imagine Bernadetta would work well with Defiant Speed -&nbsp;if you can get her HP low enough you can get +5 Atk, +8 Spd from this and Persecution Complex.
				</p>

				<p>
					&nbsp;
				</p>

				<p>
					<span style="color:#f1c40f;"><strong>Dark Bishop - Lifetaker&nbsp;</strong>(Advanced)</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					Lifetaker is a solid enough skill, letting you be a little bit more aggressive with your mages than otherwise. It's not amazing (especially with how prevalent ranged healing is in 3H, making it fairly easy to top people up even when distant), but it has uses. It doesn't help that Dark Bishop isn't a great class, being male exclusive and generally less good than Warlock unless your name is Hubert.
				</p>

				<p>
					&nbsp;
				</p>

				<p>
					<span style="color:#9b59b6;"><strong>Dark Knight - Seal Resistance</strong>&nbsp;(Master)</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					Seal effects are more useful on Maddening than they were on Hard, but sadly Seal Resistance will come quite late in the game. If you have several mages, this could be useful to run on at least one for taking down monsters, but sadly most bosses very late in the game are immune to debuffs.
				</p>

				<p>
					&nbsp;
				</p>

				<p>
					<span style="color:#444444;"><strong>Dark Mage - Poison Strike</strong>&nbsp;(Intermediate)</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					Male only, not a great effect but has some use against bosses and some giant beasts. As others have noted, the -20% damage can tick after a giant beast loses a health bar, knocking off a significant amount of health. Unfortunately it's rather awkward to get in practical situations as it competes directly with Fiendish Blow, both needing the same Reason C rank to get, but if you overlook that it's not a bad skill.
				</p>

				<p>
					&nbsp;
				</p>

				<p>
					<span style="color:#9b59b6;"><strong>Falcon Knight - Defiant Avo</strong>&nbsp;(Master)</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					See Gremory for an overview of Defiant skills
				</p>

				<p>
					+30 avoid when very low on HP has some use - on an avoid centric build, this can make you near invulnerable on low HP. It's not a completely foolproof strategy, but if you can get the skill and some avoid bonuses set up on your character, it definitely has a solid niche. Even without a build around it, enemy hit rates late in the game are not too amazing, even on Maddening - +30% avoid could well be enough that you survive a fair bit more often just on its own.
				</p>

				<p>
					&nbsp;
				</p>

				<p>
					<span style="color:#f1c40f;"><strong>Grappler - Tomebreaker, Fierce Iron Fist</strong>&nbsp;(Advanced)</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					Fierce Iron Fist is probably the best of the class exclusive combat arts, especially on high strength characters like Raphael, Dedue, Alois and Gilbert. A guaranteed three hit combo is extremely powerful, getting a whole lot of kills on even bosses from full health, and add in that its durability cost is negligible (5 durability for 3 hits, on a weapon type with very high durability) and you'll probably find yourself using it every player phase, or close enough. On the other hand, being exclusive to Grappler is frustrating - you probably want to advance to War Master for Quick Riposte, meaning you may have to delay and come back for Fierce Iron Fist later (which also comes with a small stat drop compared to War Master) - or you have to give up the opportunity to get Quick Riposte at all. Still, this is a powerful art that helps a lot against the durable late game foes on Maddening.
				</p>

				<p>
					Tomebreaker feels very niche. Mages are squishy and easy to kill on player phase, and on enemy phase you don't really want your gauntlet users facing mages - but I suppose +20 avoid against them is something.
				</p>

				<p>
					&nbsp;
				</p>

				<p>
					<span style="color:#3498db;"><b>Great Lord - Paraselene</b>&nbsp;(Unique)</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					Has similar issues to Wind God in that it's only going to be available late, and this one is a little more suspect overall - Great Lord is a decent class, but there's more argument to do other things with Dimitri, and while Paraselene is very strong in terms of raw damage it isn't anywhere near as versatile as Wind God. Still, it's a strong art if you do pick up it - but this one is straddling more on the edge of&nbsp;Low Tier.
				</p>

				<p>
					&nbsp;
				</p>

				<p>
					<span style="color:#9b59b6;"><strong>Gremory - Defiant Mag&nbsp;</strong>(Master)</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					The Defiant skills are all kind of similar in their issues, so to avoid repeating myself here's a short summary: They are VERY powerful effects, but 25% HP is low. That's "almost certainly dead if hit" low. So using these skills requires a lot of care. On top of that, they're mostly unlocked from Master classes, with a few from Advanced classes. This makes it almost impossible&nbsp;to pick up several at once, and so it's difficult to stack more than one - but if you want to make good use of them you really want several.&nbsp;As a result it's hard to actually make good combinations outside of NG+ without grinding - and those are two things I noted this list assumes we aren't doing.
				</p>

				<p>
					Defiant Mag in particular is one of the more useful ones, but it's also on a Master class which means it's difficult to master. Worse, that master class is female only, so those defiant stacks for mages only work for females. It's okay, but it will come very late. It can synergise with Vantage for enemy phase kills, or with Desperation on a fast mage for player phase nuking.
				</p>

				<p>
					&nbsp;
				</p>

				<p>
					<span style="color:#f1c40f;"><strong>Hero -&nbsp;Defiant Str</strong>&nbsp;(Advanced)</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					See Gremory for an overview of Defiant skills.
				</p>

				<p>
					This is probably the single best Defiant skill, mainly because it's in a strong stat and unlocked by an advanced class. It can synergise with Vantage and either Wrath, Defiant Crit or Defiant Speed for a powerful enemy phase, or perhaps with Desperation and Defiant Speed for player phase nuking.
				</p>

				<p>
					&nbsp;
				</p>

				<p>
					<span style="color:#f1c40f;"><strong>Paladin - Aegis&nbsp;</strong>(Advanced)</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					Halved damage every now and again is nice. Helps to increase reliability of surviving. Unfortunately, it does become available a little bit late. I don't have too much else to say honestly - this is probably bordering on Lower Mid tier actually.
				</p>

				<p>
					&nbsp;
				</p>

				<p>
					<span style="color:#f1c40f;"><strong>Sniper - Hunter's Volley</strong>&nbsp;(Advanced)</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					A very nice art that's sadly locked in to a class you'd probably rather move on from. Hunter's Volley definitely has a niche if you do stay as a Sniper, guaranteed double attacks is functionally similar to a Brave Bow - but with better stats if you use a good Bow. It's definitely a useful art and if you stay as a Sniper, you'll get value out of it - but it does come with a tough choice of giving up the extra +1 range, +3 move and Canto you could get as a Bow Knight, if you want to take advantage.
				</p>

		<p>
			&nbsp;
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Low Tier</strong>&nbsp;- These mastery skills are generally mediocre. They can have some uses on occasion, but generally struggle due to significant issues - either the class giving the skill is not good, or the skill is weak, or the classes are Mastery classes, giving you too little time to benefit significantly. They are often not worth planning around unless the skill is critical to a build idea you have.

					<span style="color:#444444;"><strong>Armoured Knight - Armoured Blow</strong>&nbsp;(Intermediate)</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					Not an especially useful blow skill. When you're attacking you want to kill the enemy, not take 6 damage less.
				</p>

				<p>
					&nbsp;
				</p>

				<p>
					<span style="color:#f1c40f;"><strong>Assassin - Lethality, Assassinate</strong>&nbsp;(Advanced)</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					Lethality is a very RNG skill, not the best when you can often kill in one round anyway with other options - having a low% kill chance is okay. I'm not entirely sure how Assassinate works, I'm guessing it's a high chance to activate Lethality (maybe Dex% or 2xDex%?) but it's exclusive to Assassin, so meh.
				</p>

				<p>
					&nbsp;
				</p>

				<p>
					<span style="color:#444444;"><strong>Cavalier - Desperation</strong>&nbsp;(Intermediate)</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					Perhaps the biggest issue with Desperation is that, in 3H, Cavaliers and Paladins are a bit slow, both having a negative speed modifier while mounted and a negative speed growth, while Desperation is a skill which only has benefit if you're fast. So to benefit from Desperation you need to be careful with your class progression, or just get it on a naturally very fast character like Ingrid. This problem has become even worse on Maddening, where it can be tough to double many enemies even for faster characters. As a result, Desperation is a pretty niche skill overall - it's pretty good on paper but just very awkward to make work in practice.
				</p>

				<p>
					&nbsp;
				</p>

				<p>
					<span style="color:#3498db;"><strong>Emperor - Flickering Flower</strong>&nbsp;(Unique)</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					A very strong art, but plagued with issues - being exclusive to Edelgard who has the shortest route, you may only get very few chapters to take advantage. It's also locked to the Emperor class, which is often not considered a good class for Edelgard to use.&nbsp; However, if you do stay the path you will be rewarded with a very valuable art, both high in power and with nice utility as well.

					<span style="color:#f1c40f;"><strong>Fortress Knight - Pavise&nbsp;</strong>(Advanced)</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					Pavise is a small Dex based chance to reduce damage taken. It's certainly nice to have, but not something hugely reliable, not to mention the characters most likely to learn Pavise often have very high Def anyway - making it slightly redundant in a way. Okay, but not amazing.

					<span style="color:#9b59b6;"><strong>Great Knight - Defiant Def</strong>&nbsp;(Master)</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					See Gremory for an overview of Defiant skills
				</p>

				<p>
					One of the less useful Defiant skills. If you're facing all physical enemies +8 defence could be a bit deal, but generally if your Great Knight is getting weak, I'd say it's more likely to be mages causing issues. Add in that this isn't a very good class to begin with and I don't see much value in it.

				<p>
					<span style="color:#9b59b6;"><strong>Mortal Savant -&nbsp;</strong><strong>Warding Blow</strong>&nbsp;(Master)</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					This comes very late and gives a blow effect that is not very good. Basically see Armoured Knight with Armoured Blow, but worse.
				</p>

				<p>
					<span style="color:#444444;"><strong>Priest - Miracle</strong>&nbsp;(Intermediate)</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					Not the best skill ever, but it's a little more useful in 3H thanks to the inclusion of Divine Pulse. Rather than it only triggering in situations you probably don't want to be in because it might mean losing, it triggers in situations that maybe you're willing to try since it's only a minor inconvenience if it fails.

				</p>

				<p>
					<span style="color:#444444;"><strong>Thief - Steal</strong>&nbsp;(Intermediate)</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					Steal/Thief utility has always been somewhat debated, but in 3H there just isn't enough of value to steal. A few maps do have nice things - an extra anti-effective damage shield for your fliers or mounts is pretty nice (even ignoring the effective damage negation, they're 0 weight with +3 def) but overall, there's just not enough to really justify going out of your way to get Steal. If you do go through thief, take advantage where possible, but don't worry about missing out on valuable steals if not - you won't miss much.

				<p>
					<span style="color:#f1c40f;"><strong>Warlock - Bowbreaker</strong>&nbsp;(Advanced)</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					Perhaps one of the best in Low Tier, this has some value - mages are decent for luring archers and taking them out due to also having good range (especially with various relics that increase it), but it's not something incredible that you want to do regularly.

			<strong>Bottom Tier</strong>&nbsp;- these are skills that are in most cases either nearly worthless, or extremely niche. They may be unreasonably hard to get, of very little value when obtained, very restricted to who can get them or some combination.

					<span style="color:#444444;"><strong>Brawler - Unarmed Combat</strong>&nbsp;(Intermediate)</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					I can't see any real good reason to use Unarmed Combat. It basically trades one skill slot for a weapon slot. A&nbsp;<em>really bad</em>&nbsp;weapon. If you have any other gauntlets, Unarmed Combat is useless. If you don't have any other gauntlets, you probably don't have Brawling Prowess, and so this still feels like a dubious choice. Just give your character Iron Gauntlets, they're a lot more accurate, still really light and have +1 might as well. And use that extra skill slot for something useful.
				</p>

				</p>

				<p>
					<span style="color:#3498db;"><strong>Armoured Lord, High Lord, Wyvern Master - Pomp &amp; Circumstance</strong>&nbsp;(Unique)</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					Clumping all of these because the reward is the same, and it's bad regardless. The lords all have very high charm, so +4 charm almost never helps with extra gambit hit (there's a cap on it, I think based on having enough charm over the enemy). +4 Luck is also not much, 2 crit, 4 crit evade. No hit for physical attacks, and no avoid in 3H. Combined, you still get barely anything. They have better skill options by this point.
				</p>

				<p>
					<span style="color:#9b59b6;"><strong>Holy Knight - Defiant Res</strong>&nbsp;(Master)</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					See Gremory for an overview of Defiant skills
				</p>

				<p>
					Even less useful than Defiant Def due to mages being less common than physical units, and generally easy to kill. Plus, very few if any characters are best as Holy Knights. This is a skill that has very little application, and it's hard to get.
				</p>

				<p>
					&nbsp;
				</p>

				<p>
					<span style="color:#444444;"><strong>Lord - Resistance +2, Subdue</strong>&nbsp;(Intermediate)</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					Resistance +2 is not especially useful, way less good than the Beginner class skills. Subdue is pretty niche, especially as it's a sword skill - and the three characters who can get the Lord class&nbsp;are better focused on other weapons than Swords. It's a bad class, with bad mastery bonuses, what a combination.
				</p>

				<p>
					&nbsp;
				</p>

				<p>
					<span style="color:#f1c40f;"><strong>Swordmaster - Astra</strong>&nbsp;(Advanced)</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					If Astra weren't locked to Swordmaster, it would&nbsp;<em>maybe</em>&nbsp;have some use. It's not a great art, but being a multiplier on damage means it can at least do something even if it's very expensive. Unfortunately, there are better classes even among advanced classes for a sword user to take, so there's not much incentive to stay in Swordmaster - a mediocre art is not very convincing. As a result, mastering Swordmaster doesn't really give anything of value.
