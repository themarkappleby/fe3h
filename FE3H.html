Between class growths, class bases, stat changes for being in them, promotion requirements, mastery skills, adjutant type and so on, there’s a lot to cover. In this post and the next I will be attempting to explain every class’ role in efficient play, whether as an end-class or something to get for the class mastery. This post assumes you’re familiar with the basics of classes of 3H – if you’re not, check out the <a href="/classes">Classes section on this site</a> to catch up . Also, this post assumes no access to the paid DLC most of the time, but I will talk about the DLC classes. Finally, these analyses are for regular NG runs, although the same concepts apply to NG+.</p><p class="ta-card-section-paragraph ta-no-margin">I'll be splitting up the discussions into early-mid game classes and mid-late game classes. This post will cover the former, so unique classes (except the house leader story ones), beginner classes, and intermediate classes.</p></main></section><section class="

HP +5 is a deceptively strong mastery because the bulk increase is fairly significant, there really aren’t better skills to equip for a good while and for Vengeance purposes it’s basically damage +5. Physical units are ok with staying in the Noble/Commoner early on before Class Mastery +1 since they won’t make much headway into mastering Beginner classes anyway, but magic units want to escape into Monk ASAP, because of the halved magic uses severely dampening their performance.</p><div class="ta-classes-post-header"><span>Dancer</span></div><p class="ta-card-section-paragraph ta-no-margin ta-margin-bottom-loose">Dancing OP, more at 11. While the analysis could stop there, I want to talk about how to pick the dancer. Generally you want it to be someone who can win the competition to begin with – 9 charm before picking the dancer + the dance lesson will guarantee it. It should be someone struggling to contribute otherwise for the most part. Players often cite the availability of Movement +1 from A+ riding as a deciding factor for picking the dancer but between how late that comes (or in the case of Crimson Flower possibly not at all) and the abundance of mobility options in 3H it’s not as important of a factor in my opinion. I’m personally a fan of the siege tome linked attack factor, but you need to consider that for it to be effective you want the dancer to be able to support a large amount of your team to even give them the +hit/avo bonuses. As such, I believe the standouts to be Dorothea (linked attack Meteor, supports all the Black Eagles and Felix/Ingrid/Sylvain from Blue Lions <span class="ta-tooltip-activator" data-tip="true" data-for="rip-lorenz" currentitem="false">but no one from GD</span><div class="__react_component_tooltip t77c294dd-2ba0-4a00-b025-d1498eb064f3 place-top type-dark" id="rip-lorenz" data-id="tooltip"><style>

Bernadetta has Pass and wouldn’t have much issues with getting Movement +1 but I haven’t found Pass to be that relevant on the Dancer outside of Azure Moon LTCs.</p><p class="ta-card-section-paragraph ta-no-margin">There’s <a href="/bugs/infinite_dancer_experience">a bug</a> where if you auto-battle during the first 10 turns, the 10 turn limit on dance experience is lifted.

The 1 bonus speed while in the class is usually pretty negligible, but the biggest issues are its mastery abilities - which is the defining factor in which Beginner class you choose. Speed +2 is not that good on Maddening given how tiered speed inflation is, the 5 slot limitation alongside Darting Blow existing and there’s no reward for overkilling speed (Lance Jab and Burning Quake only run a 0.3x modifier for the stat which isn’t good enough to be worth it). Swap is the worst of the positioning combat arts overall as the point of them on Maddening is to shift positions to be out of range or to cover more ground with your units overall.</p><div class="ta-classes-post-header"><span>Soldier</span></div><p class="ta-card-section-paragraph ta-no-margin ta-margin-bottom-loose">The class you go into for Reposition. Defense +2 is neat but overall gets phased out quickly. I will say that Reposition is, while nice, not as “end all be all” as some players claim it to be. Overall, you want to go into this class if you’re not going to be running a Brave combat art (or Vengeance) and will be going a flier route, but don’t mind the loss of attack power or have different skills to equip than Strength +2 from Fighter.</p><div class="ta-classes-post-header"><span>Fighter</span></div><p class="ta-card-section-paragraph ta-no-margin ta-margin-bottom-loose">Probably the best of the physical beginner classes, as Strength +2 is very handy when using brave combat arts and Shove is a good positioning skill overall. The +1 Strength bonus from being in the class is also nice in the early game where your offensive options are worse overall. An important tidbit about the class is that for recruitable units, anyone who you recruit as this class will have at least D axes/bows/gauntlets – this is very handy for units that are not going to autolevel into Brigand as out-of-house recruits later (which has a significant strength boost) and want those ranks, like Balthus, Bernadetta or Ignatz.</p><div class="ta-classes-post-header"><span>Monk</span></div><p class="ta-card-section-paragraph ta-no-margin">If you want a magic using class in Beginner, this is the only one. It’s a lot better than Noble/Commoner by virtue of having full magic uses, so everyone using magic wants to promote into it. Magic +2 remains a relevant ability for magic users for basically the entire game and Draw Back is a very useful combat art, so this is a very important class to mages. It’s worth pointing out this class is a Heal Adjutant, so this is the earliest non-attack adjutant you can get. Same as with Fighter, all recruited units who go through Monk will have a guaranteed D rank in Reason/Faith, which is relevant for units who don’t autolevel both. Examples of such units are Lysithea, Annette, Dorothea or Marianne, all of whom you’d want to recruit in the Chapter 3-5 stretch, which is when they are Monks.</p></main></section><section class="

As a result, a large part of choosing which intermediate class to go for is tied simply to class masteries, and these are the classes I will cover first. <a href="/classes/intermediate">Click here</a> for a full list.</p><div class="ta-classes-post-header"><span>Brigand</span></div><p class="ta-card-section-paragraph ta-no-margin ta-margin-bottom-loose">A +2 HP and Strength modifier alone is good enough reason to stay in the class, but the mastery ability of Death Blow helps any physical oriented unit and will likely remain equipped for the entire game. As such, a large part of building physical units usually involves reaching D+ axes to promote into this class. +6 attack on player phase is huge, not much else to say really.</p><div class="ta-classes-post-header"><span>Archer</span></div><p class="ta-card-section-paragraph ta-no-margin ta-margin-bottom-loose">Honestly Hit +20 might be an even more important mastery on Maddening than Death Blow. The enemy avoid gets inflated a lot due to stats and weapon prowesses increasing, and as such even offensive magic units want this skill (without DLC). Having Bow Range +1 is also really handy, since it makes Curved Shot 2-4 range and allows for very flexible offense. Definitely route in getting D+ bows for this class.</p><div class="ta-classes-post-header"><span>Lord</span></div><p class="ta-card-section-paragraph ta-no-margin ta-margin-bottom-loose">Only available to Edelgard, Dimitri and Claude. Not a particularly enticing class as the mastery skills are not worth it and the Charm skill loses in value when compared to a house leader in an actual good class. The one recommendation I've seen for this class is Silver Snow Edelgard if going just for that route, but for that you could set her to Solo Faith focus and reach Heal/Recover/Stride status at chapter 7. Overall would not recommend.</p><div class="ta-classes-post-header"><span>Mercenary</span></div><p class="ta-card-section-paragraph ta-no-margin ta-margin-bottom-loose">While the bonuses of +1 Strength and Speed are good, realistically the only reason any unit will promote into to this class is for Vantage, (going for a combination with Wrath/Battalion Wrath). If the unit doesn’t benefit from Vantage, there is no reason to go into this class, since Thief is better for sheer stats.</p><div class="ta-classes-post-header"><span>Thief</span></div><p class="ta-card-section-paragraph ta-no-margin ta-margin-bottom-loose">This class has a fairly significant base Speed of 11 (Mercenary has 10) and a +2 Speed modifier. While it shares the 5 movement of Mercenary, it has unrestricted forest movement as well as Lockpick/Steal utility. Steal is an ability worth situationally considering – in particular Chapter 6 has two Magic Staves, Chapter 7 has two stealable Evasion Rings on the other house leaders, Ladislava on non-CF Chapter 16 has a stealable Aurora Shield. Remember to combine Speed food (<a href="/monastery/dining_hall">Dining Hall guide here</a>), Rally Speed, and Seal Speed in the scenarios you need to. Other than the mobility and Steal utility, you should seriously consider going into the other good mastery classes.</p><div class="ta-classes-post-header"><span>Armored Knight</span></div><p class="ta-card-section-paragraph ta-no-margin ta-margin-bottom-loose">It has the highest base Defense in intermediate at 12, which is actually a significant amount for a lot of units. Hence, if you have a relatively easy way to access it, it’s worth certifying just for the Defense boost. Other than that, it’s not actually a bad class for a unit going the Fortress Knight/Grappler/War Master route as long as you stack defense with everything you can, but you will want to master Brigand and Archer beforehand. This class is also significant as the only Guard Adjutant option for female units that they can easily get – male units usually prefer Brawler for this purpose.</p><div class="ta-classes-post-header"><span>Cavalier</span></div><p class="ta-card-section-paragraph ta-no-margin ta-margin-bottom-loose">The 7 movement along with Canto mobility combined with still having access to ground battalions can be really handy in the level 10-20 period, especially for builds like Vengeance. The biggest issue with this class is that it’s not Brigand and Archer, as its mastery of Desperation isn’t really useful on Maddening. You can however master those 2 classes in easier battles while using Cavalier’s mobility for the difficult ones like Gronder 1, so it’s just something to keep in mind rather than a sign to not use Cavalier at all. The Speed decrease isn’t really significant as on Maddening Speed is so tiered you might as well forget about Speed with most of your units.</p><div class="ta-classes-post-header"><span>Pegasus Knight</span></div><p class="ta-card-section-paragraph ta-no-margin ta-margin-bottom-loose">Probably the single best intermediate class in terms of fighting prowess since it has 6 movement, +3 Speed, flight, and Darting Blow, which is good for any unit that relies on their sheer stats for combat. The main limiting factor of this class is the bad availability of flier battalions in the early-mid game, so you probably don’t want to have too many at the same time, especially since Brigand/Archer need mastering too. This is also the easiest accessible class to adjutant for fliers, since they can only get flying adjutants. If going for Falcon Knight, do not stay in Pegasus Knight but rather pass Wyvern Rider with C axe C flight for better stats (or better yet just go for Wyvern Lord instead).</p><div class="ta-classes-post-header"><span>Brawler</span></div><p class="ta-card-section-paragraph ta-no-margin ta-margin-bottom-loose">You’re going to be a guard adjutant. That’s it. The class modifiers and mobility are similar to a thief, but realistically if you’re in a class for stats, you’re in Brigand for the +2 Strength and for masteries you want to master Death Blow and Hit +20.</p><div class="ta-classes-post-header"><span>Mage</span></div><p class="ta-card-section-paragraph ta-no-margin ta-margin-bottom-loose">Between getting Fire for free and mastering Fiendish Blow this is the most useful intermediate magic class. There isn’t much else to say, +6 magical attack is really useful. Sometimes you don’t need much to be a good class to begin with.</p><div class="ta-classes-post-header"><span>Dark Mage</span></div><p class="ta-card-section-paragraph ta-no-margin ta-margin-bottom-loose">Once you have Fiendish Blow, this is actually a worthy consideration for male magic units. It has 1 more bonus Magic and Heartseeker over Mage, so in terms of sheer combat performance it’s actually better. Poison Strike isn’t that all that useful though, besides from Golden Deer final boss cheesing (he isn't immune to it).</p><div class="ta-classes-post-header"><span>Priest</span></div><p class="ta-card-section-paragraph ta-no-margin">For when you don’t care about attacking and/or have already mastered Mage and just want to be the best Physic healer you can be. Miracle is meme/10, but White Magic Heal +5 and 20 Heal uses is nothing to shake a stick at. Also, White Magic Heal +5 (and later White Magic Heal +10) do indeed affect Heal Adjutants’ healing.</p></main></section><section class="

If Astra was better in 3H it could’ve been a saving grace, but since it cuts each hit to 30% damage it’s a really bad combat art overall. The only other use is if you’re going for a crit build on someone like Dimitri who can’t access War Master easily but wants to boost their crit rate with something like Wo Dao+ for their combo setup, then the class could be decent for that, but overall it’s better to stick to something with better mobility instead. Oh and obviously this class is useful on an early-recruited Catherine due to a lack of different options and it coming so soon.</p><div class="ta-column ta-margin-bottom-normal"><div class="ta-classes-later-game-class-header"><span>Assassin</span></div><span><b>Role:</b> General stat offense, unpenalized ground movement, Stealth.</span><span><b>Worth as an end class?</b> No.</span></div><p class="ta-card-section-paragraph ta-no-margin ta-margin-bottom-loose">A lot of the problems that affect Swordmasters affect Assassins as well – while you do have 6 movement and unrestricted forest movement, you’re still sacrificing a lot of killing power and forcing yourself to rely on lucky stat growths to keep up with enemy stats in the long run. The sad truth is that swords just don’t have many tools available to kill enemies efficiently besides relying on crits, and as such Assassin just isn’t recommended. Its mastery abilities are extremely unreliable so the only other gimmick of the class is Stealth, which while it could be used for interesting strategies where a unit gets ignored, ends up falling short by the lack of killing power.</p><div class="ta-column ta-margin-bottom-normal"><div class="ta-classes-later-game-class-header"><span>Hero</span></div><span><b>Role:</b> Vantage/Wrath enemy phase combat, class mastery.</span><span><b>Worth as an end class?</b> No, but useful to swap into depending on map.</span></div><p class="ta-card-section-paragraph ta-no-margin ta-margin-bottom-loose">Generally regarded as the worst of the sword-focused classes, it’s ironically the best one. The trick to its success is that innate Vantage – while it is true mastering Mercenary can give you Vantage too, this way you don’t have to grind class mastery and/or can equip some other skill in its place. This combined with Battalion Wrath can create a really low investment unit with a large enemy phase killing potential – examples include Alois, Seteth and Jeritza, all of whom start with Battalion Wrath and join late, so not requiring mastering Mercenary is a good boon. Other than this, the other reason to go into this class is for the useful mastery ability: Defiant Strength’s 8 Str boost is very significant when a large portion of offense happens on Player Phase, or just to boost a wrath/vantage setup. You can calculate damage taken or use something like Blessing to get within the threshold then just don’t get hit and reap the benefits with something like Hunter’s Volley or Fierce Iron Fist. Overall, a really good situational class that gets underrated.</p><div class="ta-column ta-margin-bottom-normal"><div class="ta-classes-later-game-class-header"><span>Fortress Knight</span></div><span><b>Role:</b> Defense tanking.</span><span><b>Worth as an end class?</b> No, but useful to swap into depending on map.</span></div><p class="ta-card-section-paragraph ta-no-margin ta-margin-bottom-loose">People think that efficient players just dismiss armors automatically and that they’re near worthless. In 3H however, there are good incentives to having one character be a Fortress Knight – namely so that the player can pump all of their defense boosters and their best +Prt battalions into one unit, and that combined with their 17 Def base and +10 Def modifier gives you a LOT of protection, which is not to be underestimated (for a good example, Edelgard in Cindered Shadows with a Steel Shield). Generally the unit you want to make a Fortress Knight is also your Grappler/War Master, as these 3 usually coincide with the rank requirements and are boons of the people inclined to go into them. It depends on the situation at hand, but don’t underestimate the power of potentially just outright tanking hits with no additional help required from other units. For units not interested in going into the class, it can still be worth certifying for the 35 HP 17 Def bases if you can afford to spend the skill ranks.</p><div class="ta-column ta-margin-bottom-normal"><div class="ta-classes-later-game-class-header"><span>Wyvern Rider</span></div><span><b>Role:</b> General stat offense, flier mobility.</span><span><b>Worth as an end class?</b> No, but only because Wyvern Lord is a direct upgrade.</span></div><p class="ta-card-section-paragraph ta-no-margin ta-margin-bottom-loose">You’ve probably heard the Wyvern Emblem memes – and they’re only half exaggerated. This class combines ease of access (seriously you can pass this at C axe C flight if you rig the exam) with good stat modifiers coupled with the most powerful weapon type – a recipe for success. The growths are good too for what that’s worth, but overall the question to ask yourself is “Why shouldn’t a unit be a Wyvern?”. The class is usually better for female units due to their access to Darting Blow (unless the male unit has something like Swift Strikes), but generally it just works really well. Bow weakness isn’t a major issue as not only are there items to negate it but you can also dismount after moving and mount before moving. Seal Defense isn’t too useful generally but it has situational use against monsters, so it's up to the player's discretion. The main limiting factor is the utility of other classes, only having access to flying battalions and flying adjutants, which limits your options. As such, you don’t actually want TOO many Wyverns, as it has diminishing returns over having a bit more variety. Still, 4-5 is a fine number and even if a unit doesn’t plan on going Wyvern Lord in the end, this is a good side class to have.</p><div class="ta-column ta-margin-bottom-normal"><div class="ta-classes-later-game-class-header"><span>Paladin</span></div><span><b>Role:</b> Combat Art/Ability offense, high ground mobility.</span><span><b>Worth as an end class?</b> Yes.</span></div><p class="ta-card-section-paragraph ta-no-margin ta-margin-bottom-loose">With Wyverns being overall better at combat and being easier to access, what does Paladin have to offer? Besides having higher damage with lances, which is potentially relevant for things like Swift Strikes, the main advantage is that they have access to ground battalions which are generally better and have some unique gambits like Impregnable Wall, as well as ground adjutants – namely Guard Adjutants, allowing them to tank certain enemies that’d otherwise flat out kill. Another thing is that on maps which don’t limit your mobility a lot, the movement type advantage of wyverns is mitigated, so paladin can match it while being grounded. It’s also useful for someone like Dimitri who wouldn’t want to go into Wyvern Lord due to the high rank investment but still wants a good mobility option for his offense that isn’t stat reliant – other examples of this are Leonie and Bernadetta. One other use for the class is if you have someone who you only need for non-combat utility like rallies or gambit usage, then the high movement is really useful for them.</p><div class="ta-column ta-margin-bottom-normal"><div class="ta-classes-later-game-class-header"><span>Warrior</span></div><span><b>Role:</b> Class mastery.</span><span><b>Worth as an end class?</b> No.</span></div><p class="ta-card-section-paragraph ta-no-margin ta-margin-bottom-loose">With Wyvern Rider, Paladin, Grappler, and then later War Master existing, there is no real reason to consider this as an end class for a character, since the aforementioned outclass Warrior in just about every way. The only real reason to go into this class outside of some very specific strat is mastering it for Wrath, which while not the easiest thing to get because of the certification requirement, is worth it for Vantage/Wrath setups.</p><div class="ta-column ta-margin-bottom-normal"><div class="ta-classes-later-game-class-header"><span>Grappler</span></div><span><b>Role:</b> Combat Art offense, unpenalized ground movement.</span><span><b>Worth as an end class?</b> Yes.</span></div><p class="ta-card-section-paragraph ta-no-margin ta-margin-bottom-loose">The main draw of this class is its mastery combat art – Fierce Iron Fist, which allows you to hit an enemy 3 times in a row with a gauntlet. Given that on Maddening you won’t be doubling most enemies, this is very useful and even though War Master has Crit +20, this class is overall better for player phase nuking (FIF boosts crit by 10 so at the end you have better chances of critting as a Grappler once in 3 strikes than as a War Master once in 2 strikes). It also has no movement penalty through forests, meaning it’s a mobile class, moreso than Sniper. With enough offense stacking you’ll ORKO most enemies that aren’t in a suit of armor or a monster, and even for monsters you debatably could with crits. A really good class overall and you really need to consider whether to end as this or as a War Master.</p><div class="ta-column ta-margin-bottom-normal"><div class="ta-classes-later-game-class-header"><span>Sniper</span></div><span><b>Role:</b> Combat Art offense at high range.</span><span><b>Worth as an end class?</b> Yes.</span></div><p class="ta-card-section-paragraph ta-no-margin ta-margin-bottom-loose">Just like Grappler, you’re in this class for the mastery – Hunter’s Volley. The ability to shoot a bow twice in a row regardless of what bow it is is amazing, especially when stacked with something like a Killer Bow+. Sniper has lower mobility than Grappler but can shoot at longer distances (2-4 range), so you have better reach overall. Once again, stack offensive skills on a Sniper and watch enemies die in one round of combat – even on 0% growths really. Crit stacking heavily encouraged, as Hunter’s Volley also gives +10 crit in addition to +1 might +15 hit.</p><div class="ta-column ta-margin-bottom-normal"><div class="ta-classes-later-game-class-header"><span>Warlock</span></div><span><b>Role:</b> Magical offense.</span><span><b>Worth as an end class?</b> No.</span></div><p class="ta-card-section-paragraph ta-no-margin ta-margin-bottom-loose">Yet another case of magic classes being “boring but reliable”, doubling black magic uses and adding +5 damage to them (but not dark magic!) is just really useful. However, this class is overall not worth staying in once master classes become available – Gremory has more movement at equal black magic uses but doubled white magic uses and only losing out on 3 damage, and Dark Knight has superior mobility and is much preferred by the male mages over Warlock. Bowbreaker isn’t that amazing either since mages struggle with dodging and you don’t really need extra hit on bow units as they’re not dodgey. So it’s a good transitional class but overall you should continue working towards one of the mentioned master classes.</p><div class="ta-column ta-margin-bottom-normal"><div class="ta-classes-later-game-class-header"><span>Dark Bishop</span></div><span><b>Role:</b> Magical offense with Heartseeker support.</span><span><b>Worth as an end class?</b> No.</span></div><p class="ta-card-section-paragraph ta-no-margin ta-margin-bottom-loose">Basically a Hubert-only class, since other dark magic users can’t even access this class (lol Jeritza) and the black magic users much prefer the offense and spell use boost of Warlock. Lifetaker isn’t that great of an ability overall since it’s mainly on magic units which are rather squishy and you can usually find something better to use. Heartseeker is nice utility for some bosses though, so Hubert can get value out of that before going into Dark Knight. Just a really meh class.</p><div class="ta-column ta-margin-bottom-normal"><div class="ta-classes-later-game-class-header"><span>Bishop</span></div><span><b>Role:</b> Support.</span><span><b>Worth as an end class?</b> Yes.</span></div><p class="ta-card-section-paragraph ta-no-margin">Between White Magic Uses x2 and White Magic Heal +10, this is the ultimate supportive class for your team. Your main team healer should be in this class, as the White Magic Heal +10 coupled with Healing Staff and having 10 physic uses allows you to top off basically anyone at large distances. Doubling the uses of Warp is also really good. While more offensively inclined female units should consider moving into Gremory, designated healers should just stick to this class.</p></main></section><section class="

However Armored Lord only has a +5 Def modifier, and given that on Maddening you want as much def as possible to tank remotely well, the class is just straight up bad. Emperor only loses 2 Def compared to Fortress Knight, but at the point it comes the map design doesn’t favor armored classes anymore, so overall these classes are not worth bothering with.</p><div class="ta-column ta-margin-bottom-normal"><div class="ta-classes-later-game-class-header"><span>High Lord/Great Lord</span></div><span><b>Role:</b> General stat/ability offense.</span><span><b>Worth as an end class?</b> No.</span></div><p class="ta-card-section-paragraph ta-no-margin ta-margin-bottom-loose">Dimitri’s unique classes, they sacrifice the mobility of a Paladin to get a better speed modifier. This is not a worthwhile trade though, as on Maddening Dimitri will not be doubling anyway and his main form of offense is the Battalion Wrath + Battalion Vantage setup, so the mobility of a Paladin is preferred – not to mention that even dismounted Paladin has equal move to a Great Lord. The mastery combat art of Great Lord – Paraselene, while useful, could just be replicated with Canto instead. Overall the most I can say about these classes is that High Lord makes Chapter 13 a pain.</p><div class="ta-column ta-margin-bottom-normal"><div class="ta-classes-later-game-class-header"><span>Wyvern Master/Barbarossa</span></div><span><b>Role:</b> General stat offense, flier mobility.</span><span><b>Worth as an end class?</b> Yes.</span></div><p class="ta-card-section-paragraph ta-no-margin ta-margin-bottom-loose">Claude’s unique classes, and they’re basically Wyvern Rider/Lord that traded its usage of axes for bows and has overall slightly worse modifers. Overall really solid classes just due to the fact you get them for free and Claude mains bows. If you’re going for a dodgetank Claude build though you want to go into Wyvern Lord as it has the Avo +10 ability which Barbarossa lacks. Wind God is quite handy if you get it since Claude lacks long-range bow combat arts, so it’s basically a better Deadeye. Not really as OP as people make it out to be but getting it for free is definitely really nice. Also it being Claude’s class for Chapter 13 really helps.</p><div class="ta-column ta-margin-bottom-normal"><div class="ta-classes-later-game-class-header"><span>Enlightened One</span></div><span><b>Role:</b> General stat offense, healing utility.</span><span><b>Worth as an end class?</b> No, unless Byleth was not trained in their ranks.</span></div><p class="ta-card-section-paragraph ta-no-margin ta-margin-bottom-loose">Byleth’s unique class, the most notable thing about it is getting it for free and being able to use magic, allowing Byleth to use Heal and Recover. That’s about all the useful spells Byleth has though, and otherwise there’s no real reason to use these classes over the other classes like Wyvern Lord. Its mastery ability of Sacred Power is really good, but nothing too essential so if you don’t feel like spending time mastering it it can be ignored. It just suffers from the same things that hinder other sword classes and even the Sublime Creator Sword can’t fully salvage the situation, as that could just be used in a Wyvern class.</p><div class="ta-column ta-margin-bottom-normal"><div class="ta-classes-later-game-class-header"><span>Death Knight</span></div><span><b>Role:</b> General stat offense, high ground mobility.</span><span><b>Worth as an end class?</b> Yes.</span></div><p class="ta-card-section-paragraph ta-no-margin">Jeritza’s unique class, you can think of it as a Paladin with 1 less movement but better modifiers. Considering his base proficiencies and stats this is very much viable as his final class, though given the final 2 maps of CF you should consider making him a Wyvern. The mastery of Counterattack really speaks for itself, though it’s worth noting that it could be not worth it if you have a lot of Retribution uses and as such don’t have to worry about the timer. Still, you can’t really go wrong with this class and the satisfaction of being able to use it is definitely there.</p></main></section><section class="

At +4 Str and Spd with 8 movement and good HP/Def to boot, there’s not much to say that hasn’t been said for Wyvern Rider already. Defiant Crit is a really good mastery too, since it’s a really strong player phase offense boost, bumping your crit to 100 when stacked further. The drawbacks of flier battalions and flier adjutants still apply here, so do consider it and don’t add TOO many of these to your team, since it starts becoming a lot worse after around 5 or so.</p><div class="ta-column ta-margin-bottom-normal"><div class="ta-classes-later-game-class-header"><span>Falcon Knight</span></div><span><b>Role:</b> General stat offense, flier mobility, class mastery.</span><span><b>Worth as an end class?</b> Yes, but overall worse than Wyvern Lord.</span></div><p class="ta-card-section-paragraph ta-no-margin ta-margin-bottom-loose">The other flier master class and it’s a lot worse than Wyvern Lord overall, due to having 3 less strength and using lances which generally have lower might than axes, making them not as desirable. The main use for this class is either for mastering it for Defiant Avoid for a dodgetank build or on units that struggle to get into Wyvern Lord but have good lance combat arts – the only real examples of this are Bernadetta and Marianne, though for the latter it’s an off-build and for Bernie it’s merely one of her many possible class choices. And even for someone like Bernie, it’s mainly a matter of convenience. Others just prefer the strength boost of Wyvern Lord way too much.</p><div class="ta-column ta-margin-bottom-normal"><div class="ta-classes-later-game-class-header"><span>Meme Savant</span></div><span><b>Role:</b> Mixed general offense.</span><span><b>Worth as an end class?</b> No.</span></div><p class="ta-card-section-paragraph ta-no-margin ta-margin-bottom-loose">Yet another case of a hybrid class being bad. Not only are swords bad on Maddening but now we have a class that half focuses on swords and half on magic and becomes bad at both. If you’re using swords you’re better off as an Assassin or Hero (or even better, Wyvern Lord) and if you’re using magic you’re better off as a Gremory or Dark Knight. This class has nothing going for it, even its mastery is meme. Just don’t bother.</p><div class="ta-column ta-margin-bottom-normal"><div class="ta-classes-later-game-class-header"><span>Great Knight</span></div><span><b>Role:</b> Mobile defense tanking.</span><span><b>Worth as an end class?</b> No.</span></div><p class="ta-card-section-paragraph ta-no-margin ta-margin-bottom-loose">This is supposed to be the upgrade to Fortress Knight but realistically reaching it is really hard, due to insanely high certification requirements. It’s mainly just Fortress Knight but more mobile, but at the point this becomes available it’s not as useful. Paladin can be certified easier and if you really need a tank then staying in Fortress Knight is honestly preferred since you can focus your rank instructions into more relevant skill areas. Only really worth it on Gilbert since he can feasibly reach the ranks, or as a meme off-meta build on Felix when stacked with Pavise/Aegis. Defiant Def is just bad, at that HP threshold you’ll likely die anyways.</p><div class="ta-column ta-margin-bottom-normal"><div class="ta-classes-later-game-class-header"><span>Bow Knight</span></div><span><b>Role:</b> High-range combat art/ability offense.</span><span><b>Worth as an end class?</b> Situationally.</span></div><p class="ta-card-section-paragraph ta-no-margin ta-margin-bottom-loose">The class combines high mobility with really high attack range, what can possibly go wrong? Turns out, the offense part. Unless you have Point-Blank Volley to turn the class into basically a different version of Swift Strikes Paladin, or are using it for utility things like Bernadetta’s Encloser while maining Vengeance for damage output, it’s worse than Sniper just because Hunter’s Volley is broken. Brave bows don’t have the stats to compensate for the offense loss, so most units on Maddening don’t want to go into this class. Another reason to go into the class is if you want a Vantage/Wrath setup without relying on Retribution, but note the range hit penalty that bows have. Defiant Spd can be useful but generally with low HP strats you’re trying to avoid counters, and while Defiant Speed can help you double attack, you want things that don’t depend on your stats to be as reliable as possible.</p><div class="ta-column ta-margin-bottom-normal"><div class="ta-classes-later-game-class-header"><span>Dark Knight</span></div><span><b>Role:</b> Mobile magic offense and utility.</span><span><b>Worth as an end class?</b> Yes.</span></div><p class="ta-card-section-paragraph ta-no-margin ta-margin-bottom-loose">Magic units who focus more on offense and non-mobility/Physic spell utility usually want to end as this class. Between good mobility both mounted and dismounted as well as both Black and Dark Tomefaires, it covers offense really well and allows for hit-and-run strats, especially with range-extending skills and staves. Also useful if using combat arts like Frozen Lance, 1-range healing spells like Recover, or utility gambits like Dance of the Goddess or Blessing. A really cool class which, while you need to weigh it against Gremory depending on unit, is really good when Gremory doesn’t provide enough utility for a unit from doubled spell uses.</p><div class="ta-column ta-margin-bottom-normal"><div class="ta-classes-later-game-class-header"><span>Holy Knight</span></div><span><b>Role:</b> Mobile magic offense and utility.</span><span><b>Worth as an end class?</b> No.</span></div><p class="ta-card-section-paragraph ta-no-margin ta-margin-bottom-loose">Take everything that makes Dark Knight good besides the mobility and make it bad. Faith offensive magic is nowhere near as good as Reason spells, so even a unit like Marianne would prefer Dark Knight over Holy Knight if going for a more offensive build. If going for more support then Bishop or Gremory are preferable for their doubled magic uses and better healing, so the only real use this class has is if you want to end as a Dark Knight, but didn’t have time to build up sufficient reason rank yet and are already level 30 – for example magic-based Bernadetta for the Physic/Rescue mounted utility. Other than that case, don’t bother since even the mastery ability is bad.</p><div class="ta-column ta-margin-bottom-normal"><div class="ta-classes-later-game-class-header"><span>Gremory</span></div><span><b>Role:</b> Magic offense and utility, class mastery.</span><span><b>Worth as an end class?</b> Yes.</span></div><p class="ta-card-section-paragraph ta-no-margin ta-margin-bottom-loose">The biggest assets of the class are it’s +5 magic modifier and doubled spell uses for every spell type. This makes it great for female mages who want high uses on their spells like Warp, Luna, or Meteor. With 5 movement it’s better than the advanced classes, since being stuck at 4 movement is not preferable if you can avoid it. The choice of Gremory vs. Dark Knight vs. Bishop is really unit and role dependant but you can’t really go wrong with putting a magic unit in Gremory. Defiant Mag is also really good if you can set it up as it boosts damage significantly while also boosting Physic/Warp/Rescue range.</p><div class="ta-column ta-margin-bottom-normal"><div class="ta-classes-later-game-class-header"><span>War Master</span></div><span><b>Role:</b> Enemy phase offense, class mastery.</span><span><b>Worth as an end class?</b> Yes.</span></div><p class="ta-card-section-paragraph ta-no-margin">Whereas Grappler is more heavily focused on player phase offense, this class is more focused on the enemy phase. Between Crit +20, +5 Str, and a Vantage/Wrath setup you can guarantee OHKOing on the enemy phase if you can stack your crit and hit to 100. Alternatively, after mastering Quick Riposte you get to ignore enemy Attack Speed and double them anyway, which should be combined with Retribution. So the question becomes whether you need better enemy phase in War Master or better player phase in Grappler with gauntlets. It’s worth mentioning two other things – War Master does not have unrestricted forest movement like Grappler does, and War Master Strike with sufficient strength and a really high might axe like Devil Axe+ or Freikugel you can potentially OHKO enemies, so you need to calculate which is more preferable. However mastering Master Classes takes a long time, so generally you’re better off sticking to Grappler for player phase offense.</p></main></section><section class="

However in the main game, unlike Cindered Shadows, you actually have access to more powerful positioning options in Stride, mobility Combat Arts, Warp/Rescue, or even just having better canto units – not to mention Foul Play really requires the Fetters of Dromi to work properly. Other than that this class’ offense is abysmal, it only has halved magic uses and Duelist’s Blow is really not worth it since if you’re dodgetanking you’re doing it on enemy phase, so just don’t bother.</p><div class="ta-column ta-margin-bottom-normal"><div class="ta-classes-later-game-class-header"><span>War Monk/Cleric</span></div><span><b>Role:</b> General stat offense, some utility, class mastery.</span><span><b>Worth as an end class?</b> No.</span></div><p class="ta-card-section-paragraph ta-no-margin ta-margin-bottom-loose">Meant as a hybrid between a magic user and a fist fighter, it unsurprisingly fails at both. It shares the issue of halved magic uses with Trickster and has worse modifiers and abilities for physical offense – no Fierce Iron Fist or +5 Str and Crit +20. Pneuma Gale isn’t even worth it on magic-inclined units as those would prefer Aura Gauntlets + Fierce Iron Fist. Brawl Avo +20 is useful if you’re building a gauntlet-based dodgetank, so this is the one reason to go into the class. Even females who otherwise have no Fistfaire class options don’t really like it since it’s just so lacking in everything.</p><div class="ta-column ta-margin-bottom-normal"><div class="ta-classes-later-game-class-header"><span>Valkyrie</span></div><span><b>Role:</b> Mobile grounded magic offense and support, class mastery.</span><span><b>Worth as an end class?</b> No, but useful in reaching one.</span></div><p class="ta-card-section-paragraph ta-no-margin ta-margin-bottom-loose">Finally a good DLC class, this is the mounted magical class before level 30. Having +4 magic, 6 movement, and Black/Dark Magic Range +1 while being grounded makes this a very good choice for any female mage to consider going into. The mastery ability of Uncanny Blow is really good and can replace Hit +20 training if you prefer to not build bow rank then be an adjutant. This class overall gets obsoleted by Dark Knight but it’s very nice in-between class before it – or if you just want the class mastery you can go into Gremory or Dark Flier later. Really good addition to the game.</p><div class="ta-column ta-margin-bottom-normal"><div class="ta-classes-later-game-class-header"><span>Dark Flier</span></div><span><b>Role:</b> Mobile magic offense and support, flier mobility.</span><span><b>Worth as an end class?</b> Yes, but only for one unit.</span></div><p class="ta-card-section-paragraph ta-no-margin">Relive the Awakening glory days for 25 dollars, galeforce excluded. In all seriousness, this is a really useful class as 7 movement with flying and being able to use spells is really handy, but it has it’s limitations. The main one is that there only exists one battalion that gives +Mag and is flying – Nuvelle Fliers Corps which gives +7 Mag. If you don’t have that battalion and/or are a dark magic user, you lose way too much offensive power as the class has no magic modifier and no Dark Tomefaire, only Black, so while this is a really useful class to have on your team, you generally want to stick to only one of it.</p></main></section><section class="
